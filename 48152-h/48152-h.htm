<h2 id="steam">THE STEAM-ENGINE,<br />
<span class="subhead">AND THE DISCOVERIES OF JAMES WATT.</span></h2>

<p>Although the plan of this new edition of Beckmann’s ‘History
of Inventions and Discoveries’ was to confine it to the
subjects treated of in the original work, yet we feel it imperative
to make an exception in favour of the <i>Steam-Engine</i>,
the most important of all modern inventions.</p>

<p>The power of steam was not entirely unknown to the
ancients, but before the æra rendered memorable by the discoveries
of <span class="smcap">James Watt</span>, the steam-engine, which has since
become the object of such universal interest, was a machine
of extremely limited power, inferior in importance and usefulness
to most other mechanical agents used as prime
movers. Hero of Alexandria, who lived about 120 years before
the birth of Christ, has left us the description of a
machine, in which a continued rotatory motion was imparted
to an axis by a blast of steam issuing from lateral orifices in
arms placed at right angles to it. About the beginning of
the seventeenth century, a French engineer, De Caus, invented
a machine by which a column of water might be
raised by the pressure of steam confined in the vessel, above
the water to be elevated; and in 1629, Branca, an Italian
philosopher, contrived a plan of working several mills by a
blast of steam against the vanes; from the descriptions,
however, which have been left us of these contrivances, it
does not appear that their projectors were acquainted with
those physical properties of elasticity and condensation on
which the power of steam as a mechanical agent depends.</p>

<p>In 1663, the celebrated Marquis of Worcester described
in his Century of Inventions, an apparatus for raising water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
by the expansive force of steam only. From this work we
extract the following short account of the first steam-engine.
“68. An admirable and most forcible way to drive up water
by fire; not by drawing or sucking it upwards, for that must
be as the philosopher calleth it, <i>intra sphæram activitatis</i>,
which is but at such a distance. But this way hath no
bounder, if the vessel be strong enough: for I have taken a
piece of whole cannon, whereof the end was burst, and filled
it three-quarters full of water, stopping and screwing up the
broken end as also the touch-hole; and making a constant
fire under it, within twenty-four hours it burst and made a
great crack; so that having a way to make my vessels so that
they are strengthened by the force within them, and the one
to fill after the other, I have seen the water run like a constant
stream, forty feet high: one vessel of water rarefied by
fire, driveth up forty of cold water; and a man that tends the
work is but to turn two cocks, that one vessel of water being
consumed, another begins to force and refill with cold water,
and so successively; the fire being tended and kept constant,
which the self-same person may likewise abundantly perform
in the interim, between the necessity of turning the said
cocks.”</p>

<p>The next name to be mentioned in connection with the progressive
history of the invention of the steam-engine, is that
of Denis Papin, a native of France, who, being banished from
his country, was established Professor of Mathematics at the
University of Marburg, by the Landgrave of Hesse. He first
conceived the important idea of obtaining a moving power by
means of a piston working in a cylinder (1688), and subsequently
(1690) that of producing a vacuum in the cylinder
by the sudden condensation of steam by cold. In accordance
with these ideas he constructed a model consisting of a small
cylinder, in which was inserted a solid piston, and beneath
this a small quantity of water; on applying heat to the bottom
of the cylinder, steam was generated, the elastic force of which
raised the piston; the cylinder was then cooled by removing
the fire, when the steam condensed and became again converted
into water, thus creating a vacuum in the cylinder, into
which the piston was forced by the pressure of the atmosphere;
there is, however, no evidence of his having carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
that or any other machine into practical use, before machines
worked by steam had been constructed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first actual working steam-engine of which there is any
record, was invented by Captain Savery an Englishman, to
whom a patent was granted in 1698 for a steam-engine to be
applied to the raising of water, &amp;c. This gentleman produced
a working-model before the Royal Society, as appears from
the following extract from their Transactions:&mdash;“June 14th,
1699. Mr. Savery entertained the Royal Society with showing
a small model of his engine for raising water by help of
fire, which he set to work before them: the experiment succeeded
according to expectation, and to their satisfaction.”
This engine, which was used for some time to a considerable
extent for raising water from mines, consisted of a strong iron
vessel shaped like an egg, with a tube or pipe at the bottom,
which descended to the place from which the water was to
be drawn, and another at the top, which ascended to the place
to which it was to be elevated. This oval vessel was filled
with steam supplied from a boiler, by which the atmospheric
air was first blown out of it. When the air was thus expelled,
and nothing but pure steam left in the vessel, the communication
with the boiler was cut off, and cold water poured
on the external surface. The steam within was thus condensed
and a vacuum produced, and the water drawn up from
below in the usual way by suction. The oval steam-vessel
was thus filled with water; a cock placed at the bottom of
the lower pipe was then closed, and steam was introduced
from the boiler into the oval vessel above the surface of the
water. This steam being of high pressure, forced the water
up the ascending tube, from the top of which it was discharged;
and the oval vessel being thus refilled with steam,
the vacuum was again produced by condensation, and the
same process was repeated by using two oval steam-vessels,
which would act alternately; one drawing water from below,
while the other was forcing it upwards, by which an uninterrupted
discharge of water was produced. Owing to the
danger of explosion, from the high pressure of the steam
which was used, and from the enormous waste of heat by unnecessary
condensation, these engines soon fell into disuse.</p>

<p>Several ingenious men now turned their attention to the
improvement of the steam-engine, with a view to reduce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
consumption of fuel, which was found to be so immense as
to preclude its use except under very favourable circumstances;
and in 1705, Thomas Newcomen, a blacksmith or
ironmonger, and John Cawley, a plumber and glazier, patented
their atmospheric engine, in which at first condensation
was effected by the affusion of cold water upon the
external surface of the cylinder, which was introduced into a
hollow casing by which it was surrounded. Having accidentally
observed that an engine worked several strokes with
unusual rapidity without the supply of condensing water,
Newcomen found, on examining the piston, a hole in it
through which the water poured on to keep it air-tight issued
in the form of a little jet, and instantly condensed the
steam under it; this led him to abandon the casing and to
introduce a pipe furnished with a cock, into the bottom of the
cylinder, by which water was supplied from a reservoir.
Newcomen’s engine required the constant attendance of some
person to open and shut the regulating and condensing valves,
a duty which was usually entrusted to boys, called <i>cock-boys</i>.
It is said that one of these boys, named Humphrey Potter,
wishing to join his comrades at play, without exposing himself
to the consequences of suspending the performance of
the engine, contrived by attaching strings of proper length to
the levers which governed the two cocks, to connect them
with the beam, so that it should open and close the cocks as
it moved up and down, with the most perfect regularity. By
this simple contrivance the steam-engine for the first time
became an automaton.</p>

<p>It was in repairing a working model of a steam-engine on
Newcomen’s principle for the lectures of the professor of
natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow, that James
Watt directed his mind to the prosecution of those inventions
and beautiful contrivances, by which he gave to senseless
matter an almost instinctive power of self-adjustment, with
precision of action more than belongs to any animated being,
and which have rendered his name celebrated over the world.</p>

<p>At the time of which we speak, Newcomen’s engine was of
the last and most approved construction. The moving power
was the weight of the air pressing on the upper surface of a
piston working in a cylinder; steam being employed at the
termination of each downward stroke to raise the piston with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
its load of air up again, and then to form a vacuum by its
condensation when cooled by a jet of cold water, which was
thrown into the cylinder when the admission of steam was
stopped. Upon repairing the model, Watt was struck by the
incapability of the boiler to produce a sufficient supply of
steam, though it was larger in proportion to the cylinder than
was usual in working engines. This arose from the nature
of the cylinder, which being made of brass, a better conductor
of heat than cast-iron, and presenting, in consequence
of its small size, a much larger surface in proportion to its
solid content than the cylinders of working engines, necessarily
cooled faster between the strokes, and therefore at
every fresh admission consumed a greater proportionate quantity
of steam. But being made aware of a much greater
consumption of steam than he had imagined, he was not satisfied
without a thorough inquiry into the cause. With this
view he made experiments upon the merits of boilers of
different constructions; on the effect of substituting a less
perfect conductor, as wood, for the material of the cylinder;
on the quantity of coal required to evaporate a given quantity
of water; on the degree of expansion of water in the form
of steam: and he constructed a boiler which showed the
quantity of water evaporated in a given time, and thus enabled
him to calculate the quantity of steam consumed at each
stroke of the engine. This proved to be several times the
content of the cylinder. He soon discovered that, whatever
the size and construction of the cylinder, an admission of hot
steam into it must necessarily be attended with very great
waste, if in condensing the steam previously admitted, that
vessel had been cooled down sufficiently to produce a vacuum
at all approaching to a perfect one. If, on the other hand,
to prevent this waste, he cooled it less thoroughly, a considerable
quantity of steam remained uncondensed within, and
by its resistance weakened the power of the descending stroke.
These considerations pointed out a vital defect in Newcomen’s
engine; involving either a loss of steam, and consequent
waste of fuel; or a loss of power from the piston’s
descending at every stroke through a very imperfect vacuum.</p>

<p>It soon occurred to Watt, that if the condensation were
performed in a separate vessel, one great evil, the cooling of
the cylinder, and the consequent waste of steam, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
avoided. The idea once started, he soon verified it by experiment.
By means of an arrangement of cocks, a communication
was opened between the cylinder, and a distinct vessel
exhausted of its air, at the moment when the former was
filled with steam. The vapour of course rushed to fill up the
vacuum, and was there condensed by the application of external
cold, or by a jet of water; so that fresh steam being
continually drawn off from the cylinder to supply the vacuum
continually created, the density of that which remained might
be reduced within any assignable limits. This was the great
and fundamental improvement.</p>

<p>Still, however, there was a radical defect in the atmospheric
engine, inasmuch as the air being admitted into the
cylinder at every stroke, a great deal of heat was abstracted,
and a proportionate quantity of steam wasted. To remedy
this, Watt excluded the air from the cylinder altogether; and
recurred to the original plan of making steam the moving
power of the engine, not a mere agent to produce a vacuum.
In removing the difficulties of construction which beset this
new plan, he displayed great ingenuity and powers of resource.
On the old plan, if the cylinder was not bored quite
true, or the piston not accurately fitted, a little water poured
upon the top rendered it perfectly air-tight, and the leakage
into the cylinder was of little consequence, so long as the
injection water was thrown into that vessel. But on the new
plan, no water could possibly be admitted within the cylinder;
and it was necessary, not merely that the piston should be
air-tight, but that it should work through an air-tight collar,
that no portion of the steam admitted above it might escape.
This he accomplished by packing the piston and the stuffing-box,
as it is called, through which the piston-rod works, with
hemp. A further improvement consisted in equalising the
motion of the engine by admitting the steam alternately above
and below the piston, by which the power is doubled in the
same space, and with the same strength of material. The
vacuum of the condenser was perfected by adding a powerful
pump, which at once drew off the condensed and injected
water, and with it any portion of air which might find admission;
as this would interfere with the action of the engine
if allowed to accumulate. His last great change was to cut off
the communication between the cylinder and the boiler, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
a portion only, as one-third or one-half, of the stroke was performed;
leaving it to the expansive power of the steam to complete
it. By this, œconomy of steam was obtained, together
with the power of varying the effort of the engine according
to the work which it has to do, by admitting the steam through
a greater or smaller portion of the stroke.</p>

<p>These are the chief improvements which Watt effected at
different periods of his life. He was born June 19, 1736, at
Greenock, where he received the rudiments of his education.
Having at an early age manifested a partiality for the practical
part of mechanics, he went in his eighteenth year to
London to obtain instruction in the profession of a mathematical
instrument-maker, but remained there little more than
a year, being compelled to return home on account of his
health. In 1757, shortly after his return home, he was appointed
instrument-maker to the University of Glasgow, and
accommodated with premises within the precincts of that
learned body. In 1763 he removed into the town of Glasgow,
intending to practise as a civil engineer. His first patent is
dated June 5, 1769, which parliament extended in 1775 for
twenty-five years in consideration of the national importance
of the inventions, and the difficulty and expense of introducing
them to public notice. He died at his house at
Heathfield in the county of Stafford, on the 25th of August,
1819, at the advanced age of eighty-four, after having realized
an ample fortune, the well-earned reward of his industry and
ability.</p>

<p>To enter into the history of the various applications of the
steam-engine to the different branches of industry would
carry us beyond the bounds of this work. “To enumerate
its present effects,” says a well-known writer on the <span class="locked">steam-engine<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>,
“would be to count almost every comfort and every
luxury of life. It has increased the sum of human happiness,
not only by calling new pleasures into existence, but by so
cheapening former enjoyments as to render them attainable
by those who before could never have hoped to share them:
the surface of the land, and the face of the waters are traversed
with equal facility by its power; and by thus stimulating
and facilitating the intercourse of nation with nation,
and the commerce of people with people, it has knit together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
remote countries by bonds of amity not likely to be broken.
Streams of knowledge and information are kept flowing between
distant centres of population, those more advanced
diffusing civilization and improvement among those that are
more backward. The press itself, to which mankind owes in
so large a degree the rapidity of their improvement in modern
times, has had its power and influence increased in a manifold
ratio by its union with the steam-engine. It is thus that
literature is cheapened, and by being cheapened, diffused;
it is thus that reason has taken the place of force, and the
pen has superseded the sword; it is thus that war has almost
ceased upon the earth, and that the differences which inevitably
arise between people and people are for the most part
adjusted by peaceful negotiation.”</p>

<h2 id="lending">LENDING AND PAWNBROKING.</h2>

<p>It appears singular to us at present that it should have been
once considered unlawful to receive interest for lent money;
but this circumstance will excite no wonder when the reason
of it is fully explained. The different occupations by which
one can maintain a family without robbery and without war,
were at early periods neither so numerous nor so productive
as in modern times; those who borrowed money required it
only for immediate use, to relieve their necessities or to procure
the conveniences of life; and those who advanced it to
such indigent persons did so either through benevolence or
friendship. The case now is widely different. With the assistance
of borrowed money people enter into business, and
carry on trades, from which by their abilities, diligence, or
good fortune, so much profit arises that they soon acquire more
than is requisite for their daily support; and under these circumstances
the lender may undoubtedly receive for the beneficial
use of his money a certain remuneration, especially as
he himself might have employed it to advantage; and as by
lending it he runs the risk of losing either the whole or a part
of his capital, or at least of not receiving it again so soon as
he may have occasion for it.</p>

<p>Lending on interest, therefore, must have become more
usual in proportion as trade, manufactures, and the arts were
extended; or as the art of acquiring money by money became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
more common: but it long continued to be detested, because the
ancient abhorrence against it was by an improper construction
of the Mosaic law converted into a religious <span class="locked">prejudice<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>, which,
like many other prejudices more pernicious, was strengthened
and confirmed by severe papal laws. The people, however,
who often devise means to render the faults of their legislators
less hurtful, concealed this practice by various inventions, so
that neither the borrower nor lender could be punished, nor
the giving and receiving of interest be prevented. As it was
of more benefit than prejudice to trade, the impolicy of the
prohibition became always more apparent; it was known that
the new-invented usurious arts under which it was privately
followed would occasion greater evils than those which had
been apprehended from lending on interest publicly; it was
perceived also that the Jews, who were not affected by papal
maledictions, foreigners, and a few natives who had neither
religion nor conscience, and whom the church wished least of
all to favour, were those principally enriched by it.</p>

<p>In no place was this inconvenience more felt than at the
Romish court, even at a time when it boasted of divine infallibility;
and nowhere was more care employed to remove it.
A plan, therefore, was at length devised, by which the evil, as
was supposed, would be banished. A capital was collected
from which money was to be lent to the poor for a certain
period on pledges without interest. This idea was indeed not
new; for such establishments had long before been formed
and supported by humane princes. The emperor Augustus,
we are told, converted into a fund the surplus of the money
which arose to the State from the confiscated property of criminals,
and lent sums from it, without interest, to those who
could pledge effects equal to double the <span class="locked">amount<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>. Tiberius
also advanced a large capital, from which those were supplied
with money for three years, who could give security on
lands equivalent to twice the <span class="locked">value<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>. Alexander Severus reduced
the interest of money by lending it at a low rate, and
advancing sums to the poor without interest to purchase lands,
and agreeing to receive payment from the produce of <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
These examples of the ancients were followed in modern
Italy. In order to collect money, the popes conferred upon
those who would contribute towards that object a great many
fictitious advantages, which at any rate cost them nothing.
By bulls and holy water they dispensed indulgences and eternal
salvation; they permitted burthensome vows to be converted
into donations to lending-houses; and authorised the
rich who advanced them considerable sums to legitimate such
of their children as were not born in wedlock. As an establishment
of this kind required a great many servants, they endeavoured
to procure these also on the same conditions; and
they offered, besides the above-mentioned benefits, a great many
others not worth notice, to those who would engage to discharge
gratis the business of their new undertaking; but in cases of
necessity they were to receive a moderate salary from the
funds. This money was lent without interest for a certain
time to the poor only, provided they could deposit proper
pledges of sufficient value.</p>

<p>It was, however, soon observed that an establishment of
this kind could neither be of extensive use nor of long duration.
In order to prevent the secret lending of money, by the
usurious arts which had begun to be practised, it was necessary
that it should advance sums not only to those who were
poor in the strictest sense of the word, but to those also who,
to secure themselves from poverty, wished to undertake and
carry on useful employments, and who for that purpose had
need of capitals. However powerful the attractions might be,
which, on account of the religious folly that then prevailed,
induced people to make large contributions, they gradually
lost their force, and the latter were lessened in proportion,
especially as a spirit of reformation began soon after to break
out in Germany, and to spread more and more into other
countries. Even if a lending-house should not be exhausted
by the maintenance of its servants, and various accidents that
could not be guarded against, it was still necessary, at any rate,
to borrow as much money at interest as might be sufficient to
support the establishment. As it was impossible that it could
relieve all the poor, the only method to be pursued was to prevent
their increase, by encouraging trade, and by supplying those
with money who wanted only a little to enable them to gain
more, and who were in a condition and willing to pay a moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
interest. The pontiffs, therefore, at length resolved to
allow the lending-houses to receive interest, not for the whole
capitals which they lent, but only for a part, merely that they
might raise as much money as might be sufficient to defray
their expenses; and they now, for the first time, adopted the
long-established maxim, that those who enjoy the benefits
should assist to bear the burthen&mdash;a maxim which very clearly
proves the legality of interest. When this opening was once
made, one step more only was necessary to place the lending-houses
on that judicious footing on which they would in all
probability have been put by the inventor himself, had he not
been under the influence of prejudice. In order that they
might have sufficient stock in hand, it was thought proper to
give to those who should advance them money a moderate interest,
which they prudently concealed by blending it with the
unavoidable expenses of the establishment, to which it indeed
belonged, and which their debtors, by the practice a little
before introduced, were obliged to make good. The lending-houses,
therefore, gave and received interest. But that the
odious name might be avoided, whatever interest was received,
was said to be <i>pro indemnitate</i>; and this is the expression made
use of in the papal bull.</p>

<p>All this, it must be confessed, was devised with much ingenuity:
but persons of acuteness still discovered the concealed
interest; and a violent contest soon arose respecting the
legality of lending-houses, in which the greatest divines and
jurists of the age took a part; and by which the old question,
whether one might do anything wicked, or establish interest,
in order to effect good, was again revived and examined.
Fortunately for the pontifical court, the folly of mankind was
still so great that a bull was sufficient to suppress, or at least
to silence, the spirit of inquiry. The pope declared the holy
mountains of piety, “sacri monti de pietà,” to be legal; and
threatened those with his vengeance who dared to entertain any
further doubts on the subject. All the cities now hastened to
establish lending-houses; and their example was at length
followed in other countries. Such, in a general view, is the
history of these establishments: I shall now confirm it by the
necessary proofs.</p>

<p>When under the appellation of <i>lending-house</i> we understand
a public establishment where any person can borrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
money upon pledges, either for or without interest, we must
not compare it to the <i>tabernæ argentariæ</i> or <i>mensæ nummulariæ</i>
of the Romans. These were banking-houses, at which
the state and rich people caused their revenues to be paid,
and on which they gave their creditors orders either to receive
their debts in money, or to have the sums transferred
in their own name, and to receive security for them. To
assign over money and to pay money by a bill were called
<i>perscribere</i> and <i>rescribere</i>; and an assignment or draft was
called <i>attributio</i>. These <i>argentarii</i>, <i>mensarii</i>, <i>nummularii</i>,
<i>collybistæ</i> and <i>trapezitæ</i> followed the same employment, therefore,
as our cashiers or bankers. The former, like the latter,
dealt in exchanges and discount; and in the same manner
also they lent from their capital on interest, and gave interest
themselves, in order that they might receive a greater. Those
who among the ancients were enemies to the lending of money
on interest brought these people into some disrepute; and
the contempt entertained for them was probably increased by
prejudice, though those <i>nummarii</i> who were established by
government as public cashiers held so exalted a rank that
some of them became consuls. Such banking-houses existed
in the Italian States in the middle ages, about the year 1377.
They were called <i>apothecæ seu casanæ feneris</i><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>, and in Germany
<i>Wechselbanke</i>, banks of exchange; but they were not
lending-houses in the sense in which I here understand them.</p>

<p>Equally distinct also from lending-houses were those banks
established in the fourteenth century, in many cities of Italy,
such, for example, as Florence, in order to raise public loans.
Those who advanced money on that account received an obligation
and monthly interest, which on no pretext could be
refused, even if the creditor had been guilty of any crime.
These obligations were soon sold with advantage, but oftener
with loss; and the price of them rose and fell like that of the
English stocks, but not so rapidly; and theologists disputed
whether one could with a safe conscience purchase an obligation
at less than the stated value, from a proprietor who
was obliged to dispose of it for ready specie. If the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
was desirous or under the necessity of repaying the money, it
availed itself of that regale called by Leyser <i>regale falsæ monetæ</i>,
and returned the capital in money of an inferior value.
This establishment was confirmed, at least at Florence, by the
pontiff, who subjected those who should commit any fraud in
it to ecclesiastical punishment and a fine, which was to be
carried to the papal treasury: but long before that period the
republic of Genoa had raised a loan by mortgaging the public
revenues. I have been more particular on this subject, because
Le <span class="locked">Bret<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> calls these banks, very improperly, lending-houses;
and in order to show to what a degree of perfection
the princely art of contracting and paying debts was brought
so early as the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Those who have as yet determined the origin of lending-houses
with the greatest exactness, place it, as Dorotheus
Ascanius, that is Matthias <span class="locked">Zimmermann<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span>, does, in the time of
Pope Pius II. or Paul II., who filled the papal chair from 1464
to 1471; and the reason for supposing it to have been under
the pontificate of the latter is, because Leo X. in his bull,
which I shall quote hereafter, mentions that pope as the first
who confirmed an establishment of this kind. As the above
account did not appear to me satisfactory, and as I knew before
that the oldest lending-houses in Italy were under the
inspection of the Franciscans, I consulted the Annals of the
Seraphic Order, with full expectation that this service would
not be omitted in that work; and I indeed found in it more
materials towards the history of lending-houses than has ever
been collected, as far as I know, by any other person.</p>

<p>As complaints against usury, which was practised by many
Christians, but particularly by the Jews, became louder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
more public in Italy in the fifteenth century, Barnabas Interamnensis,
probably of Terni, first conceived the idea of establishing
a lending-house. This man was originally a physician;
had been admitted to the degree of doctor; was held
in great respect on account of his learning; became a Minorite,
or Franciscan; acquired in that situation every rank of
honour, and died, in the first monastery of this order at Assisi
(<i>in monte Subasio</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>), in the year 1474. While he was employed
in preaching under Pope Pius II. at Perugia, in the
territories of the Church, and observed how much the poor
were oppressed by the usurious dealings of the Jews, he made
a proposal for raising a capital by collections, in order to lend
from it on pledges to the indigent, who should give monthly,
for the use of the money borrowed, as much interest as might
be necessary to pay the servants employed in this establishment,
and to support it. Fortunatus de Copolis, an able jurist
of Perugia, who after the death of his wife became also a
Franciscan, approved of this plan, and offered to assist in putting
it into execution. To be assured in regard to an undertaking
which seemed to approach so near to the lending on
interest, both these persons laid their plan before the university
of that place, and requested to know whether such an
establishment could be allowed; and an answer being given
in the affirmative, a considerable sum was soon collected by
preaching, so that there was a sufficiency to open a lending-house.
Notwithstanding this sanction, many were displeased
with the design, and considered the receiving of interest, however
small it might be, as a species of usury. Those who
exclaimed most against it were the Dominicans (<i>ex ordine
Prædicatorum</i>): and they seem to have continued to preach
in opposition to it, till they were compelled by Leo X. to be
silent; while the Franciscans, on the other hand, defended it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and endeavoured to make it be generally adopted. The dispute
became more violent when, at the end of a year, after
all expenses were paid, a considerable surplus was found remaining;
and as the managers did not know how to dispose
of it, they at length thought proper to divide it amongst the
servants, because no fixed salaries had been appointed for
them. Such was the method first pursued at Perugia; but
in other places the annual overplus was employed in a different
manner. The particular year when this establishment
began to be formed I have nowhere found marked; but as
it was in the time of Pius II., it must have been in 1464, or
before that <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>. It is very remarkable that this pontiff
confirmed the lending-house at Orvieto (<i>Urbs Vetus</i>) so early
as the above year; whereas that at Perugia was sanctioned,
for the first time, by Pope Paul II. in 1467. It is singular
also that Leo X., in his confirmation of this establishment,
mentions Paul II., Sixtus IV., Innocent VIII., Alexander VI.
and Julius II.; but not Pius II. Pope Sixtus IV., as Wadding
says, confirmed in 1472 the lending-house at Viterbo, which
had, however, been begun so early as 1469, by Franciscus de
Viterbo, a <span class="locked">Minorite<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1479 Sixtus IV. confirmed the lending-house
which had been established at Savona, the place of his birth,
upon the same plan as that at Perugia. The bull issued for
this purpose is the first pontifical confirmation ever <span class="locked">printed<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>;
for that obtained for Perugia was not, as we are told by the
editor, to be found in the archives there in 1618, the time
when the other was printed. I have never found the confirmation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of those at Orvieto and Viterbo. Ascianus sought
for them, but without success, in Bullarium Magnum Cherubini,
and they are not mentioned by Sixtus. This pontiff, in
his bull, laments that the great expenses to which he was
subjected did not permit him to relieve his countrymen with
money, but that he would grant to the lending-house so many
spiritual advantages, as should induce the faithful to contribute
towards its support; and that it was his desire that money
should be lent from it to those who would assist gratis during
a year in the business which it required. If none could be
found to serve on these conditions, a moderate salary was to
be given. He added a clause also respecting pledges; but
passed over in silence that the debtors were to contribute anything
for the support of the institution by paying interest,
which Barnabas, whose name does not occur in the bull, introduced
however at Perugia, and which the pope tacitly approved.</p>

<p>The greater part of the lending-houses in Italy were established
in the fifteenth and following centuries by the Minorites
Marcus Bononiensis, Michael a <span class="locked">Carcano<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span>, Cherubinus
Spoletanus, Jacobus de Marchia, Antonius Vercellensis, Angelus
a Clavasio, and above all, Bernardinus Tomitano, named
also <i>Feltrensis</i> and <i>Parvulus</i>. This man was born at Feltri,
in the country of Treviso, in the year 1439. His father was
called Donato Tomitano, and his mother Corona Rambaldoni;
they were both of distinguished families, though some assert
that he was of low extraction, and a native of Tomi, a small
place near Feltri, on which account he got the name of Tomitano.
The name of <i>Parvulus</i> arose from his diminutive
stature, which he sometimes made a subject of <span class="locked">pleasantry<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span>.
This much at any rate is certain, that he had received a good
education. In 1456, when seventeen years of age, he suffered
his instructors, contrary to the inclination of his father, to
carry him to Padua, to be entered in the order of the Minorites;
and on this occasion he changed his christian-name
Martin into Bernardinus. As he was a good speaker, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
employed by his order in travelling through Italy and preaching.
He was heard with applause, and in many parts the
people almost paid him divine honours. The chief object of
his sermons was to banish gaming, intemperance, and extravagance
of dress; but he above all attacked the Jews, and
excited such a hatred against them, that the governments in
many places were obliged to entreat or to compel him either
to quit their territories or not to preach in opposition to these
unfortunate people, whom the crowds he collected threatened
to massacre; and sometimes when he visited cities where there
were rich Jews and persons who were connected with them
in trade, he was in danger of losing even his own life. Taking
advantage of this general antipathy to the Jews, he exerted
himself, after the example of Barnabas, his brother Minorite,
to get lending-houses established, and died at Pavia in the
year 1494. The Minorites played a number of juggling tricks
with his body, pretending that it performed miracles, by which
means they procured him a place in the catalogue of the
saints; and to render his name still more lasting, some of his
sermons have been printed among the works of the writers of
the Franciscan <span class="locked">order<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span>.</p>

<p>The lending-houses in Italy, with the origin of which I am
acquainted, are as follows:&mdash;The lending-house at Perugia was
inspected in 1485 by Bernardinus, who enlarged its capital.</p>

<p>The same year he established one at Assisi, which was
confirmed by Pope Innocent, and which was visited and improved
by its founder in <span class="locked">1487<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1486, after much opposition, he established a
lending-house at Mantua, and procured for it also the pope’s
<span class="locked">sanction<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>. Four years after, however, it had declined so
much, that he was obliged to preach in order to obtain new
donations to support it.</p>

<p>At Florence he met with still more opposition; for the
rich Jews bribed the members of the government, who wished
in appearance to favour the establishment of the lending-house,
to which they had consented eighteen years before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
while they secretly thwarted it; and some boys having once
proceeded, after hearing a sermon, to attack the houses of the
Jews, the Minorites were ordered to abstain from preaching
and to quit the <span class="locked">city<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span>. It was however completely established;
but by the Dominican Hieronymus <span class="locked">Savonarola<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1488 Bernardinus established a lending-house
at Parma, and procured for it the pope’s sanction, as well as
for one at Cesena, where the interest was defined to be “pro
salariis officialium et aliis montis oneribus perferendis.” About
the conclusion of this year he was at the other end of Italy,
where he re-established the lending-house at Aquila in the
kingdom of <span class="locked">Naples<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year following he established one at Chieti (<i>Theate</i>)
in the same kingdom, another at Rieti (<i>Reate</i>) in the territories
of the Church, a third at Narni (<i>Narnia</i>)<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>; and a
fourth at Lucca, which was confirmed by the bishop, notwithstanding
the opposition of the Jews, who did every thing in
their power to prevent it.</p>

<p>In the year 1490 a lending-house was established at Piacenza
(<i>Placentia</i>) by Bernardinus, who at the same time
found one at Genoa which had been established by the before-mentioned
Angelus a <span class="locked">Clavasio<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span>. At this period also a lending-house
was established at <span class="locked">Verona<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span>, and another at Milan by
the Minorite Michael de Aquis.</p>

<p>In 1491 a lending-house was established at Padua, which
was confirmed by Pope Alexander VI. in <span class="locked">1493<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>; and another
was established at <span class="locked">Ravenna<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>.</p>

<p>In 1492 Bernardinus reformed the lending-house at Vicenza,
where, in order to avoid the reproach of usury, the
artifice was employed of not demanding any interest, but admonishing
the borrowers that they should give a remuneration
according to their piety and ability. As people were by
these means induced to pay more interest than what was legally
required at other lending-houses, Bernardinus caused
this method to be <span class="locked">abolished<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>. He established a lending-house
also the same year in the small town of Campo S. Pietro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
not far from Padua, and expelled the Jews who had lent
upon pledges. At this period there were lending-houses at
Bassano, a village in the county of Trevisi, and also at Feltri,
which he inspected and <span class="locked">improved<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1493 Bernardinus caused a lending-house to
be established at Crema, in the Venetian dominions; another
at Pavia, where he requested the opinion of the jurists, whom
he was happy to find favourable to his design; and likewise
a third at Gubbio, in the territories of the Church. At the
same time another Franciscan established at Cremona a <i>mons
frumenti pietatis</i>, from which corn was lent out on interest to
necessitous persons; and it appears that there had been an
institution of the like kind before at <span class="locked">Parma<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1494, Bernardinus, a short time before his death,
assisted to establish a lending-house at Montagnana, in the
Venetian <span class="locked">territories<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span>, and to improve that at Brescia, which
was likely to decay, because the servants had not fixed <span class="locked">salaries<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span>.
The same year another Franciscan established the
lending-house at Modena.</p>

<p>In the year 1506 Pope Julius II. confirmed the lending-house
at Bologna. That of Trivigi was established in 1509;
and in 1512, Elizabeth of the family of Gonzaga, as widow of
duke Guido Ubaldus, established the first lending-house in
the duchy of Urbino at Gubbio, and procured permission for
it to coin <span class="locked">money<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span>.</p>

<p>The historical account I have here given, displays in the
strongest light the great force of prejudice, and particularly
of the prejudice of ecclesiastics. Notwithstanding the manifest
advantages with which lending-houses were attended,
and though a great part of them had been already sanctioned
by the infallible court of Rome, many, but chiefly Dominicans,
exclaimed against these institutions, which they did not call
<i>montes pietatis</i>, but <i>impietatis</i>. No opposition gave the Minorites
so much uneasiness as that of the Dominican Thomas
de Vio, who afterwards became celebrated as a cardinal under
the name of Cajetanus. This monk, while he taught at Pavia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
in 1498, wrote a treatise De Monte <span class="locked">Pietatis<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span>, in which he inveighed
bitterly against taking pledges and interest, even
though the latter was destined for the maintenance of the
servants. The popes, he said, had confirmed lending-houses
in general, but not every regulation that might be introduced
into them, and had only given their express approbation of
them so far as they were consistent with the laws of the
church. These words, he added, had been wickedly left out
in the bulls which had been printed; but he had heard them,
and read them, in the confirmation of the lending-house at
Mantua. I indeed find that these words are not in the copy
of that bull given in Wadding, which is said to have been
taken from the original; nor in the still older confirmation of
the lending-house at Savona. But even were they to be
found there, this would not justify Cajetan’s opposition, as the
pope in both these bulls recommended the plan of the lending-house
at Perugia to be adopted, of which receiving interest
formed a part. Bernardinus de <span class="locked">Bustis<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span>, a Minorite, took up
the cause in opposition to Cajetan, and, according to Wadding’s
account, with rather too much vehemence. Among
his antagonists were Barrianus and Franc. Papafava, a jurist
of <span class="locked">Padua<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>. As this dispute was revived with a great deal of
warmth in the beginning of the sixteenth century, it was at
length terminated by Pope Leo X., who in the tenth sitting
of the council of the Lateran declared by a particular bull
that lending-houses were legal and useful; that all doubts to
the contrary were sinful, and that those who wrote against
them should be placed in a state of <span class="locked">excommunication<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>. The
whole assembly, except one archbishop, voted in favour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
this determination; and it appears from a decree of the
council of Trent, that it also acknowledged their legality, and
confirmed <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>. Notwithstanding this decision, there were
still writers who sometimes condemned them; and who did
not consider all the decrees, at least the above one of the
Lateran council, as agreeable to justice. Among these was
Dominicus de Soto, a Dominican. All opposition, however,
in the course of time subsided, and in the year 1565, Charles
Borromeo, the pope’s legate at the council of Milan, ordered
all governments and ecclesiastics to assist in establishing
<span class="locked">lending-houses<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>.</p>

<p>Of the lending-houses established after this period in Italy,
I shall mention those only of Rome and Naples. It is very
remarkable that the pope’s capital should have been without
an institution of this kind till the year 1539, and that it should
have been formed by the exertions of Giovanni Calvo, a
Franciscan. Paul III., in his bull of confirmation, ordered
that Calvo’s successors in rank and employment should always
have the inspection of it, because the Franciscans had taken
the greatest pains to endeavour to root out <span class="locked">usury<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>.</p>

<p>The lending-house at Naples was first established in 1539 or
1540. Two rich citizens, Aurelio Paparo, and Leonardo or
Nardo di Palma, redeemed all the pledges which were at that
time in the hands of the Jews, and offered to deliver them to the
owners without interest, provided they would return the
money which had been advanced on them. More opulent
persons soon followed their example; many bequeathed large
sums for this benevolent purpose; and Toledo, the viceroy,
who drove the Jews from the kingdom, supported it by every
method possible. This lending-house, which has indeed undergone
many variations, is the largest in Europe; and it
contains such an immense number of different articles, many
of them exceedingly valuable, that it may be considered as a
repository of the most important part of the moveables of the
whole nation. About the year 1563, another establishment
of the like kind was formed under the title of <i>banco de’ poveri</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
At first this bank advanced money without interest, only to
relieve confined debtors; afterwards, as its capital increased, it
lent upon pledges, but not above the sum of five ducats without
interest. For larger sums the usual interest was <span class="locked">demanded<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>.</p>

<p>At what time the first lending-house was established at
Venice I have not been able to <span class="locked">learn<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span>. This State seems to
have long tolerated the Jews; it endeavoured to moderate
the hatred conceived against these people, and gave orders to
Bernardinus to forbear preaching against <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span>. It appears
to me in general, that the principal commercial cities of Italy
were the latest to avail themselves of this invention; because
they knew that to regulate interest by law, where trade was
flourishing, would be ineffectual or useless; or because the
rich Jew merchants found means to prevent it.</p>

<p>The name <i>mons pietatis</i>, of which no satisfactory explanation
has been as yet given, came with the invention from
Italy, and is equally old, if not older. Funds of money
formed by the contributions of different persons, for some
end specified, were long before called <i>montes</i>. In the first
centuries of the Christian æra, free gifts were collected and
preserved in churches by ecclesiastics, partly for the purpose
of defraying the expense of divine service, and partly to relieve
the poor. Such capitals, which were considered as
ecclesiastical funds, were by Prudentius, in the beginning of
the fifth century, called <i>montes annonæ</i> and <i>arca numinis</i><a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>.
Tertullian calls them <i>deposita pietatis</i><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>; and hence has been
formed <i>montes pietatis</i>. At any rate I am of opinion that the
inventor chose and adopted this name in order to give his institution
a sacred or religious appearance, and to procure it
more approbation and support.</p>

<p>I find however that those banks employed in Italy, during
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, to borrow money in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the name of States, for which the public revenues were mortgaged
and interest paid, were also called <i>montes</i><a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>. In this
sense the word is used by Italian historians of much later
times; and those are greatly mistaken, who, with Ascian and
many others, consider all these <i>montes</i> as real lending-houses.
These loan-banks or <i>montes</i> received various names, sometimes
from the princes who established them, sometimes from
the use to which the money borrowed was applied, and sometimes
from the objects which were mortgaged. Of this kind
were the <i>mons fidei</i>, or loan opened by Pope Clement VII. in
the year 1526, for defending his <span class="locked">capital<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span>; the <i>mons aluminarius</i>,
under Pope Pius IV., for which the pontifical alum-works
were pledged; the <i>mons religionis</i>, under Pius V., for
carrying on the war against the Turks; and the <i>montes farinæ</i>,
<i>carnium</i>, <i>vini</i>, &amp;c., when the duties upon these articles were
pledged as a security. To facilitate these loans, every condition
that could induce people to advance money was thought
of. Sometimes high interest was given, if the subscribers
agreed that it should cease, and the capital fall to the bank
after their death; and sometimes low interest was given, but
the security was heritable and could be transferred at pleasure.
The former were called <i>montes vacabiles</i>, and the latter
<i>montes non vacabiles</i>. Sometimes the State engaged to pay
back the capital at the end of a certain period, such for example
as nine years, as was the case in regard to the <i>mons
novennalis</i>, under Paul IV.; or it reserved to itself the option
of returning the money at such a period as it might think
proper, and sometimes the capital was sunk and the interest
made perpetual. The first kind were called <i>montes redimibiles</i>,
and the second <i>irredimibiles</i><a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>. One can here clearly discover
the origin of life-rents, annuities, tontines, and government
securities; but the further illustration of this subject I shall
leave to those who may wish to employ their talents on a
history of national debts. I have introduced these remarks,
merely to rectify a mistake which has become almost general,
and which occasioned some difficulties to me in this research;
and I shall only observe further, that the popes gave to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
loans, in order to raise their sinking credit, many of those
spiritual advantages which they conferred on the <i>montes pietatis</i>.
This error therefore was more easily propagated, as
both were called <i>montes</i>; and hence it has happened that
Ascianus and others assert that many lending-houses were
misapplied by the popes in order to raise public loans.</p>

<p>From the instances here adduced, one may see that the
first lending-houses were sanctioned by the pontiffs, because
they only could determine to the Catholics in what cases it
was lawful for them to receive interest. This circumstance
seems to have rendered the establishment of them out of
Italy difficult. At any rate the Protestants were at first averse
to imitate an institution which originated at the court of
Rome, and which, according to the prevailing prejudice of
the times, it alone could approve; and from the same consideration
they would not adopt the reformation which had
been made in the calendar.</p>

<p>The first mention of a lending-house in Germany, which I
have as yet met with, is to be found in the permission granted
by the emperor Maximilian I. to the citizens of Nuremberg,
in the year 1498, to drive the Jews from the city, and to
establish an exchange-bank. The permission further stated,
“That they should provide for their bank proper managers,
clerks, and other persons to conduct it according to their
pleasure, or as necessity might require; that such of their
fellow-citizens as were not able to carry on their trades, callings,
and occupations without borrowing and without pledging
their effects, should, on demand, according to their trade and
circumstances, receive money, for which pledges, caution
and security should be taken; that at the time of payment a
certain sum should be exacted by way of interest; that the
clerks and conductors of the bank should receive salaries for
their service from the interest; and that if any surplus remained
it should be employed for the common use of the
city of Nuremberg, like any other public fund.”</p>

<p>It here appears that the lending-houses in Germany were
first known under the name of exchange-banks, by which was
before understood any bank where money was lent and exchanged;
but it does not thence follow, as Professor Fischer
<span class="locked">thinks<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>, that they were an Italian invention. The citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Nuremberg had not then a lending-house, nor was one established
there till the year 1618. At that period they procured
from Italy copies of the regulations drawn up for
various houses of this kind, in order to select the best. Those
of the city of Augsburg however were the grounds on which
they built, and they sent thither the persons chosen to manage
their lending-house, that they might make themselves
fully acquainted with the nature of the establishment at that
<span class="locked">place<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span>. In the year 1591, the magistrates of Augsburg had
prohibited the Jews to lend money, or to take pledges; at
the same time they granted 30,000 florins as a fund to establish
a lending-house, and the regulations of it were published
in <span class="locked">1607<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, France and England, lending-houses
were first known under the name of <i>Lombards</i>, the origin of
which is evident. It is well known that in the thirteenth and
following centuries many opulent merchants of Italy, which
at those periods was almost the only part of Europe that carried
on an extensive trade, were invited to these countries,
where there were few mercantile people able to engage deeply
in commerce. For this reason they were favoured by governments
in most of the large cities; but in the course of time
they became objects of universal hatred, because they exercised
the most oppressive usury, by lending at interest and on
pledges. They were called <i>Longobardi</i> or <i>Lombardi</i>, as
whole nations are often named after a part of their country,
in the same manner as all the Helvetians are called Swiss,
and the Russians sometimes Moscovites. They were, however,
called frequently also Caorcini, Caturcini, Caursini,
Cawarsini, Cawartini, Bardi, and Amanati; names, which in
all probability arose from some of their greatest houses or
banks. We know, at any rate, that about those periods the
family of the Corsini were in great consideration at Florence.
They had banks in the principal towns for lending money;
they demanded exorbitant interest; and they received pledges
at a low value, and retained them as their own property if
not redeemed at the stated time. They eluded the prohibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of the church against interest when they found it necessary,
by causing the interest to be previously paid as a present
or a premium; and it appears that some sovereigns borrowed
money from them on these conditions. In this manner did
Edward III. king of England, when travelling through France
in the year 1329, receive 5000 marks from the bank of the
Bardi, and give then in return, by way of acknowledgement,
a bond for <span class="locked">7000<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span>. When complaints against the usurious
practices of these Christian Jews became too loud to be disregarded,
they were threatened with expulsion from the
country, and those who had rendered themselves most obnoxious
on that account, were often banished, so that those
who remained were obliged to conduct themselves in their
business with more prudence and moderation. It is probable
that the commerce of these countries was then in too infant
a state to dispense altogether with the assistance of these foreigners.
In this manner were they treated by Louis IX. in
1268, and likewise by Philip the Bold; and sometimes the
popes, who would not authorise interest, lent their assistance
by prohibitions, as was the case in regard to Henry III. of
England in 1240.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century, the Lombards in the Netherlands
paid to government rent for the houses in which they
carried on their money transactions, and something besides
for a permission. Of this we have instances at Delft in 1313,
and at Dordrecht in <span class="locked">1342<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span>. As in the course of time the
original Lombards became extinct, these houses were let,
with the same permission, for the like <span class="locked">employment<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span>; but governments
at length fixed the rate of interest which they
ought to receive, and established regulations for them, by
which usurious practices were restrained. Of leases granted
on such conditions, an instance occurs at Delft in the year
1655. In 1578, William prince of Orange recommended to
the magistrates of Amsterdam Francis Masasia, one of the
Lombards, as they were then called, in order that he might
obtain for him permission to establish a <span class="locked">lending-house<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span>, as
many obtained permission to keep billiard-tables, and Jews
letters of protection. In the year 1611, the proprietor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
such a house at Amsterdam, who during the latter part of his
lease had gained by his capital at least thirty-three and a half
per cent., offered a very large sum for a renewal of his permission;
but in 1614, the city resolved to take the lombard
or lending-house into their own hands, or to establish one of
the same kind. However odious this plan might be, a dispute
arose respecting the legality of it, which <span class="locked">Marets<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> and
Claude Saumaise endeavoured to support. The public lending-house
or lombard at Brussels was established in 1619; that
at Antwerp in 1620, and that at Ghent in 1622. All these were
established by the archduke Albert, when he entered on the
governorship, with the advice of the archbishop of Mechlin;
and on this occasion the architect Wenceslaus Coberger was
employed, and appointed inspector-general of all the lending-houses
in the Spanish <span class="locked">Netherlands<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span>. Some Italians assert that
the Flemings were the first people who borrowed money on
interest for their lending-houses; and they tell us that this
practice began in the year <span class="locked">1619<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span>. We are assured also, that
after a long deliberation at Brussels, it was at length resolved
to receive money on interest at the lending-houses. It however
appears certain that in Italy this was never done, or at
least not till a late period, and that the capitals of the lending-houses
there were amassed without giving interest.</p>

<p>This beneficial institution was always opposed in France;
chiefly because the doctors of the Sorbonne could not divest
themselves of the prejudice against interest; and some in modern
times who undertook there to accommodate people with
money on the like terms, were punished by <span class="locked">government<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span>. A
lending-house however was established at Paris under Louis
XIII., in 1626; but the managers next year were obliged to
abandon <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>. In 1695, some persons formed a capital at
Marseilles for the purpose of establishing one there according
to the plan of those in <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span>. The present <i>mont de piété</i> at
Paris, which has sometimes in its possession forty casks filled
with gold watches that have been pledged, was, by royal
command, first established in <span class="locked">1777<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span>.</p>

[The following is the rate of profit or interest which pawnbrokers
in this country are entitled to charge per calendar
month. For 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> one halfpenny; 5<i>s.</i> one penny; 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
three halfpence; 10<i>s.</i> twopence; 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> twopence halfpenny;
15<i>s.</i> threepence; 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> threepence halfpenny; £1
fourpence; and so on progressively and in proportion for any
sum not exceeding 40<i>s.</i> For every sum exceeding 40<i>s.</i> and not
exceeding 42<i>s.</i> eightpence; and for every sum exceeding 42<i>s.</i>
and not exceeding £10, threepence to every pound, and so on
in proportion for any fractional sum. Where any intermediate
sum lent on a pledge exceeds 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and does not exceed
40<i>s.</i>, a sum of fourpence may be charged in proportion to each
£1. Goods pawned are forfeited on the expiration of a year,
exclusive of the date of pawning. But it has been held that
the property is not transferred, but that the pawnbroker merely
has a right to sell the article; and consequently that, on a
claim after this period, with tender of principal and interest,
the property must be restored if unsold (Walker <i>v.</i> Smith,
5 <i>Barn.</i> and <i>Ald.</i> 439). Pledges must not be taken from persons
intoxicated or under twelve years of age. In Great Britain
pawnbrokers must take out a license, which costs £15 within
the limits of the old twopenny-post, and £7 10<i>s.</i> in other parts.
No license is required in Ireland. A second license, which
costs £5 15<i>s.</i>, is required to take in pledge articles of gold
and silver.</p>

<p>From 1833 to 1838 the number of pawnbrokers in the metropolitan
district increased from 368 to 386; in the rest of
England and Wales, from 1083 to 1194; and in Scotland,
from 52 to 88; making a total of 1668 establishments, paying
£15,419 for their licenses, besides the licenses which many of
them take out as dealers in gold and silver. The business of
a pawnbroker was not known in Glasgow until August 1806,
when an itinerant English pawnbroker commenced business
in a single room, but decamped at the end of six months; and
his place was not supplied until June 1813, when the first
regular office was established in the west of Scotland for
receiving goods in pawn. Other individuals soon entered
the business, and the practice of pawning had become so
common, that in 1820, in a season of distress, 2043 heads of
families pawned 7380 articles, on which they raised £739 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
Of these heads of families 1375 had never applied for or received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
charity of any description; 474 received occasional
aid from the relief committee, and 194 were paupers. The
capital invested in this business in 1840 was about £26,000.
Nine-tenths of the articles pledged are redeemed within the
legal period. There are no means of ascertaining the exact
number of pawnbrokers’ establishments in the large towns of
England. In 1831, the number of males above the age of
twenty employed in those at Manchester was 107; at Liverpool,
91; Birmingham, 54; Bristol, 33; Sheffield, 31.</p>

<p>The following curious return was made by a large pawnbroking
establishment at Glasgow to Dr. Cleland, who read
it before the British Association in 1836. The list comprised
the following articles:&mdash;539 men’s coats, 355 vests, 288 pairs
of trowsers, 84 pairs of stockings, 1980 women’s gowns, 540
petticoats, 132 wrappers, 123 duffies, 90 pelisses, 240 silk
handkerchiefs, 294 shirts and shifts, 60 hats, 84 bed-ticks, 108
pillows, 262 pairs of blankets, 300 pairs of sheets, 162 bed-covers,
36 tablecloths, 48 umbrellas, 102 <i>bibles</i>, 204 watches,
216 rings, and 48 <i>Waterloo medals</i>. There were about thirty
pawnbrokers in Glasgow in 1840. In the manufacturing
districts, during the prevalence of strikes, or in seasons of
commercial embarrassment, many hundreds of families pawn
the greater part of their wearing apparel and household furniture.
The practice of having recourse to the pawnbrokers
on such occasions is quite of a different character from the
habits of dependence into which many of the working classes
suffer themselves to fall, and who, “on being paid their wages
on the Saturday, are in the habit of taking their holiday clothes
out of the hands of the pawnbroker to enable them to appear
respectably on the Sabbath, and on the Monday following they
are again pawned and a fresh loan obtained to meet the exigencies
of their families for the remainder of the week.” It is
on these transactions and on such as arise out of the desire of
obtaining some momentary gratification that the pawnbrokers
make their large profits. It is stated in one of the reports on
the poor laws that a loan of threepence, if redeemed the same
day, pays annual interest at the rate of 5200 per cent.;
weekly, 866 per cent.;</p>

<p class="in0 in2">
<span class="in15">4<i>d.</i>, annual interest 3900 per cent., or 650 p. c. weekly;</span><br />
12<i>d.</i>, annual interest 1300 per cent., or 216 p. c. weekly.
</p>

<p>It is stated that on a capital of sixpence thus employed (in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
weekly loans), pawnbrokers make in twelve months 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>;
on five shillings they gain 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; on ten shillings, 22<i>s.</i> 3¼<i>d.</i>;
and on twenty shillings lent in weekly loans of sixpence, they
more than double their capital in twenty-seven weeks, and
should the goods pawned remain in their hands for the term
of twelve months (which seldom occurs), they then frequently
derive 100 per <span class="locked">cent.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span>]</p>

former is Marianus Florentinus, whose Fasciculus Chronicoram Ordinis
Minorum, which consists of five books, was used in manuscript by Wadding,
in composing his large work, and in my opinion has never been
printed. Marc. is Marcus Ulyssoponensis, whose Chronica Ordinis Minorum
I have not been able to procure, though it is translated into several

<h2 id="chemical">CHEMICAL NAMES OF METALS.</h2>

<p>As those metals earliest known, viz. copper, iron, gold, silver,
lead, quicksilver and tin, received the same names as the
nearest heavenly bodies, which appear to us largest, and have
been distinguished by the like characters, two questions arise:
Whether these names and characters were given first to the
planets or to the metals? When, where, and on what account
were they made choice of; and why were the metals named
after the planets, or the planets after the metals? The latter
of these questions, in my opinion, cannot be answered with
any degree of certainty; but something may be said on the
subject, which will not, perhaps, be disagreeable to those fond
of such researches, and who have not had an opportunity of
examining it.</p>

<p>That the present usual names were first given to the heavenly
bodies, and at a later period to the metals, is beyond all
doubt; and it is equally certain that they came from the
Greeks to the Romans, and from the Romans to us. It can
be proved also that older nations gave other names to these
heavenly bodies at much earlier periods. The oldest appellations,
if we may judge from some examples still preserved,
seem to have originated from certain emotions which these
bodies excited in the minds of men; and it is not improbable
that the planets were by the ancient Egyptians and Persians
named after their gods, and that the Greeks only adopted or
translated into their own language the names which those
nations had given <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span>. The idea that each planet was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
residence of a god, or that they were gods themselves, has
arisen, according to the most probable conjecture, from rude
nations worshiping the sun, which, on account of his beneficent
and necessary influence over all terrestrial bodies, they
considered either as the deity himself, or his abode, or, at any
rate, as a symbol of him. In the course of time, when heroes
and persons who by extraordinary services had rendered their
names respected and immortal, received divine honours, particular
heavenly bodies, of which the sun, moon and planets
seemed the fittest, were also assigned to these <span class="locked">divinities<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span>. By
what laws this distribution was made, and why one planet
was dedicated to Saturn and not to another, Pluche did not
venture to determine: and on this point the ancients themselves
are not all <span class="locked">agreed<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span>. When the planets were once dedicated
to the gods, folly, which never stops where it begins,
proceeded still further, and ascribed to them the attributes
and powers for which the deities, after whom they were named,
had been celebrated in the fictions of their mythologists.
This in time laid the foundation of astrology; and hence the
planet Mars, like the deity of that name, was said to cause
and to be fond of war; and Venus to preside over love and
its pleasures.</p>

<p>The next question is, Why were the metals divided in the
like manner among the gods, and named after them? Of
all the conjectures that can be formed in answer to this question,
the following appears to me the most probable. The
number of the deified planets made the number seven so sacred
to the Egyptians, Persians and other nations, that all
those things which amounted to the same number, or which
could be divided by it without a remainder, were supposed to
have an affinity or a likeness to and connexion with each
<span class="locked">other<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span>. The seven metals, therefore, were considered as
having some relationship to the planets, and with them to
the gods, and were accordingly named after them. To each
god was assigned a metal, the origin and use of which was
under his particular providence and government; and to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
metal were ascribed the powers and properties of the planet
and divinity of the like name; from which arose, in the course
of time, many of the ridiculous conceits of the alchemists.</p>

<p>The oldest trace of the division of the metals among the
gods is to be found, as far as I know, in the religious worship
of the Persians. Origen, in his Refutation of Celsus, who
asserted that the seven heavens of the Christians, as well as
the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream, had been borrowed
from the mysteries of Mithras, says, “Among the Persians
the revolutions of the heavenly bodies were represented by
seven stairs, which conducted to the same number of gates.
The first gate was of lead; the second of tin; the third of
copper; the fourth of iron; the fifth of a mixed metal; the
sixth of silver, and the seventh of gold. The leaden gate had
the slow tedious motion of Saturn; the tin gate the lustre and
gentleness of Venus; the third was dedicated to Jupiter; the
fourth to Mercury, on account of his strength and fitness for
trade; the fifth to Mars; the sixth to the Moon, and the last
to the <span class="locked">Sun<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span>.” Here then is an evident trace of metallurgic
astronomy, as Borrichius calls it, or of the astronomical or mythological
nomination of metals, though it differs from that
used at present. According to this arrangement, tin belonged
to Jupiter, copper to Venus, iron to Mars, and the
mixed metal to Mercury. The conjecture of Borrichius, that
the transcribers of Origen have, either through ignorance or
design, transposed the names of the gods, is highly probable:
for if we reflect that in this nomination men at first differed
as much as in the nomination of the planets, and that the
names given them were only confirmed in the course of time,
of which I shall soon produce proofs, it must be allowed that
the causes assigned by Origen for his nomination do not well
agree with the present reading, and that they appear much
juster when the names are disposed in the same manner as
that in which we now use <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
This astrological nomination of metals appears to have been
conveyed to the Brahmans in India; for we are informed that
a Brahman sent to Apollonius seven rings, distinguished by
the names of the seven stars or planets, one of which he was
to wear daily on his finger, according to the day of the <span class="locked">week<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span>.
This can be no otherwise explained than by supposing that
he was to wear the gold ring on Sunday; the silver one on
Monday; the iron one on Tuesday, and so of the rest. Allusion
to this nomination of the metals after the gods occurs
here and there in the ancients. Didymus, in his Explanation
of the Iliad, calls the planet Mars the iron star. Those who
dream of having had anything to do with Mars are by Artemidorus
threatened with a chirurgical operation, for this
reason, he adds, because Mars signifies <span class="locked">iron<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span>. Heraclides
says also in his allegories, that Mars was very properly considered
as iron; and we are told by Pindar that gold is dedicated
to the <span class="locked">sun<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span>.</p>

<p>Plato likewise, who studied in Egypt, seems to have admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
this nomination and meaning of the metals. We are
at least assured so by Marsilius <span class="locked">Ficinus<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span>; but I have been
able to find no proof of it, except where he says of the island
Atlantis, that the exterior walls were covered with copper and
the interior with tin, and that the walls of the citadel were of
gold. It is not improbable that Plato adopted this Persian or
Egyptian representation, as he assigned the planets to the
demons; but perhaps it was first introduced into his system
only by his <span class="locked">disciples<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span>. They seem, however, to have varied
from the nomination used at present; as they dedicated to
Venus copper, or brass, the principal component part of which
is indeed copper; to Mercury tin; and to Jupiter electrum.
The last-mentioned metal was a mixture of gold and silver;
and on this account was probably considered to be a distinct
metal, because in early periods mankind were unacquainted
with the art of separating these noble <span class="locked">metals<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span>.</p>

<p>The characters by which the planets and metals are generally
expressed when one does not choose to write their names,
afford a striking example how readily the mind may be induced
to suppose a connexion between things which in reality
have no affinity or relation to each other. Antiquaries and
astrologers, according to whose opinion the planets were first
distinguished by these characters, consider them as the attributes
of the deities of the same name. The circle in the
earliest periods among the Egyptians was the symbol of divinity
and perfection; and seems with great propriety to have
been chosen by them as the character of the sun, especially
as, when surrounded by small strokes projecting from its circumference,
it may form some representation of the emission
of rays. The semicircle is in like manner the image of the
moon, the only one of the heavenly bodies that appears under
that form to the naked eye. The character ♄ is supposed
to represent the sythe of Saturn; ♃ the thunderbolts of Jupiter;
♂ the lance of Mars, together with his shield; ♀ the
looking-glass of Venus; and ☿ the caduceus or wand of Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
The expression by characters adopted among the older
chemists agrees with this mythological signification only in
the character assigned to gold. Gold, according to the chemists,
was the most perfect of metals, to which all others
seemed to be inferior in different degrees. Silver approached
nearest to it; but was distinguished only by a semicircle,
which, for the more perspicuity, was drawn double, and thence
had a greater resemblance to the most remarkable appearance
of the moon; the name of which this metal had already obtained.
All the other metals, as they seemed to have a greater
or less affinity to gold or silver, were distinguished by
marks composed of the characters assigned to these precious
metals. In the character ☿ the adepts discover gold with a
silver colour. The cross placed at the bottom, which among
the Egyptian hieroglyphics had a mysterious <span class="locked">signification<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span>,
expresses, in their opinion, something I know not what, without
which quicksilver would be silver or gold. This something
is combined also with copper, the possible change of
which into gold is expressed by the character ♀. The character
♂ declares the like honourable affinity also; though
the half-cross is applied in a more concealed manner; for,
according to the most proper mode of writing, the point is
wanting at the top, or the upright line ought only to touch
the horizontal, and not to intersect it. Philosophical gold is
concealed in steel; and on this account it produces such valuable
medicines. Of tin one-half is silver, and the other
consists of the something unknown: for this reason the cross
with the half moon appears in ♃. In lead this something is
predominant, and a similitude is observed in it to silver.
Hence in its character ♄ the cross stands at the top, and the
silver character is only suspended on the right-hand behind it.</p>

<p>The mythological signification of these characters cannot
be older than the Grecian mythology; but the chemical may
be traced to a much earlier period. Some, who consider
them as remains of the Egyptian <span class="locked">hieroglyphics<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span>, pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
that they may be discovered on the table of Isis, and employ
them as a proof of the high antiquity, if not of the art of
making gold, at least of chemistry. We are told also that
they correspond with many other characters which the adepts
have left us as emblems of their wisdom.</p>

<p>If we are desirous of deciding without prejudice respecting
both these explanations, it will be found necessary to make
ourselves acquainted with the oldest form of the characters,
which in all probability, like those used in writing, were subjected
to many changes before they acquired that form which
they have at present. I can, however, mention only three
learned men, <span class="locked">Salmasius<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span>, Du <span class="locked">Cange<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Huet<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span>, who took
the trouble to collect these characters. As I am afraid that
my readers might be disgusted were I here to insert them, I
shall give a short abstract of the conclusion which they form
from them; but I must first observe that the oldest manuscripts
differ very much in their representation of these characters,
either because they were not fully established at
the periods when they were written, or because many supposed
adepts endeavoured to render their information more
enigmatical by wilfully confounding the characters; and it is
probable also that many mistakes may have been committed
by transcribers.</p>

<p>The character of Mars, according to the oldest mode of
representing it, is evidently an abbreviation of the word
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Θοῦρος</span>, under which the Greek mathematicians understood
that deity; or, in other words, the first letter <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Θ</span>, with the last
letter <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ς</span> placed above it. The character of Jupiter was originally
the initial letter of <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Ζεύς</span>; and in the oldest manuscripts
of the mathematical and astrological works of Julius
Firmicus the capital <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Ζ</span> only is used, to which the last letter <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ς</span>
was afterwards added at the bottom, to render the abbreviation
more distinct. The supposed looking-glass of Venus is
nothing else than the initial letter, a little distorted, of the
word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Φωσφόρος</span>, which was the name of that goddess. The
imaginary sythe of Saturn has been gradually formed from
the first two letters of his name <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>, which transcribers,
for the sake of dispatch, made always more convenient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
use, but at the same time less perceptible. To discover in
the pretended caduceus of Mercury the initial letter of his
Greek name <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Στίλβων</span>, one needs only look at the abbreviations
in the oldest manuscripts, where they will find that the
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Σ</span> was once written as <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Ϲ</span>; they will remark also that transcribers,
to distinguish this abbreviation still more from the rest,
placed the C thus, ◡; and added under it the next letter <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τ</span>.
If those to whom this deduction appears improbable will only
take the trouble to look at other Greek abbreviations, they
will find many that differ still further from the original letters
they express than the present character ☿ from the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Ϲ</span> and <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τ</span>
united. It is possible that later transcribers, to whom the
origin of this abbreviation was not known, may have endeavoured
to give it a greater resemblance to the caduceus
of Mercury. In short, it cannot be denied that many other
astronomical characters are real symbols, or a kind of proper
hieroglyphics, that represent certain attributes or circumstances,
like the characters of Aries, Leo, and others quoted
by Salmasius.</p>

<p>But how old is the present form of these characters? According
to <span class="locked">Scaliger<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span>, they are of great antiquity, because they
are to be found on very old gems and rings. If the ring
No. 104 in Goræus be old and accurately delineated, this
must indeed be true; for some of these characters may be
very plainly distinguished on the <span class="locked">beazel<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span>. We are told by
Wallerius that they were certainly used by the ancient Egyptians,
because Democritus, who resided five years in Egypt,
speaks of them in the plainest terms. I do not know whence
Wallerius derived this information, but it proves nothing.
He undoubtedly alludes to the laughing philosopher of Abdera,
who lived about 450 years before our æra, but no authentic
writings of his are now extant. Fabricius says that
we have a Latin translation of a work of his, De Arte Sacra,
Patavii, 1572, which, however, is certainly a production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
much later times. I have it now before me from the library
of our university; and I find that it is not the whole book,
but only an abstract, and written in so extravagant a manner
that the deception is not easily discovered. It contains chemical
processes, but nothing of the characters of metals;
which is the case also with the letters of Democritus, published
by <span class="locked">Lubbinus<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span>.</p>

<p>[By way of contrast to the seven metals with which the ancients
were acquainted, we may enumerate those known at
the present day. They are as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<h2 id="zinc">ZINC.</h2>

<p>Zinc is one of those metals which were not known to the
<span class="locked">Greeks<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span>, Romans, or Arabians. This we have reason to
conjecture, because it has not been distinguished by a chemical
character like the rest; but it is fully proved, by our
not finding in the works of the ancients any information that
appears even to allude to it. I know but of one instance
where it is supposed to have been found among remains of
antiquity. Grignon pretends that something like it was discovered
in the ruins of the ancient Roman city in <span class="locked">Champagne<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span>.
Such an unexpected discovery deserved to have
been investigated with the utmost minuteness; but it seems to
have been examined only in a very superficial manner; and
as that was the case, it is impossible to guess what kind of a
metal or metallic mixture this author considered as zinc.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that this metal should have remained
so long unknown, for it has never yet been found in the metallic
state. Its ores are often and in a great degree mixed
with foreign ingredients; and when they are melted, it sublimes
in a metallic form, and is found adhering above to
the cool sides of the furnace; but a particular apparatus is
necessary, else the reduced metal partly evaporates, and is
partly oxidized, by which means it appears like an earth, and
exhibits to the eye no traces of metal.</p>

<p>That mixture of zinc and copper called at present brass,
tomback, pinchbeck, princes-metal, &amp;c., and which was first
discovered by ores, abundant in zinc, yielding when melted
not pure copper, but brass, was certainly known to the ancients.
Mines that contained ores, from which this gold-coloured
metal was produced, were held in the highest estimation;
when exhausted, the loss of them was regretted; and
it was supposed that the metal would never be again found.
In the course of time it was remarked, no one knows by what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>accident, that an ore, which must have been calamine, when
added to copper while melting, gave it a yellow colour. This
ore was therefore used, though it was not known what metal
it contained, in the same manner as oxide of cobalt was employed
in colouring glass before mineralogists were acquainted
with that metal itself. Aristotle and Strabo speak of an
earth of that kind, the use of which in making brass has been
retained through every century. Ambrosius, bishop of Milan,
in the fourth century; Primasius, bishop of Adrumetum in
Africa, in the sixth; and Isidore, bishop of Seville, in the
seventh, mention an addition by which copper acquired a gold
colour, and which undoubtedly must have been calamine.
When in course of time more calamine was discovered, the
ancient method of procuring brass from copper-ore that contained
zinc was abandoned; and it was found more convenient
first to extract from it pure copper, and then to convert
it into brass by the addition of calamine.</p>

<p>Those desirous of inquiring further into the knowledge
which the ancients had of this metal must examine the meaning
of the word <i>cadmia</i>, which seems to have had various
significations. This task I have ventured to undertake; and
though I cannot clear up everything that occurs respecting
it, I shall lay before my readers what information I have been
able to obtain on the subject, because perhaps it may amount
to somewhat more than is to be found in the works of old
commentators. <i>Cadmia</i> signified, then, in the first place, a
mineral abounding in zinc, as well as any ore combined with
it, and also that zinc-earth which we call calamine. Those
who should understand under it only the latter, would not be
able to explain the greater part of the passages in the ancients
where it is mentioned. It is probable that ore containing
zinc acquired this name, because it first produced <span class="locked">brass<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span>.
When it was afterwards remarked that calamine gave to
copper a yellow colour, the same name was conferred on it
also. It appears, however, that it was seldom found by the
<span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span>; and we must consider <i>cadmia</i> in general as signifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
ore that contained zinc. Gold-coloured copper or brass
was long preferred to pure or common copper, and thought
to be more beautiful the nearer it approached to the best
<i>aurichalcum</i>. Brass therefore was supposed to be a more valuable
kind of copper; and on this account Pliny says that
<i>cadmia</i> was necessary for procuring copper, that is brass.
Copper, as well as brass, was for a great length of time called
<i>æs</i>, and it was not till a late period that mineralogists, in order
to distinguish them, gave the name of <i>cuprum</i> to the <span class="locked">former<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span>.
Pliny says that it was good when a large quantity of <i>cadmia</i>
had been added to it, because it not only rendered the colour
more beautiful, but increased the weight. In the like manner
a quintal of copper in Hungary produces a hundred and
fifty pounds of brass. The same author remarks also that
the <i>cadmia</i> (<i>fossilis</i>) was not used in medicine: this however
is to be understood only of the raw ore, for some physicians
prepared oxide of zinc from ore that contained zinc, as he
afterwards tells us; and Galen extols the calamine found in
Cyprus on account of its superior effects, because, perhaps,
the oxide could be obtained from it much purer.</p>

<p>In the second place, <i>cadmia</i>, among the ancients, was what
we call (<i>ofenbruch</i>) furnace-calamine, or what in melting ore
that contains zinc, or in making brass, falls to the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the furnace, and which consists of more or less calcined zinc.
As this furnace-calamine assumes various appearances, according
to the manner of melting, and according to many
other circumstances that in part cannot be defined, and as
the ancients comprehend all its varieties under the general
name of <i>cadmia</i>, and give to each variety, according to its
form, consistence and colour, a particular name also, a confusion
of names has hence arisen which cannot now be cleared
up, especially as it is not thought worth while to distinguish
all its incidental variations. Our physicians esteem only the
pure oxide of zinc; and as they know how to obtain it, they
are not under the necessity of using impure furnace-calamine.
In our melting-houses it is employed, without much nicety
in the choice, for making zinc or <span class="locked">brass<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span>.</p>

<p>What here appears to me most singular is, that the ancients
should have given the same names to furnace-calamine
as they gave to ores that contained zinc. The affinity of
these substances they could conjecture only from their effects,
or perhaps they were induced to do so from observing that
furnace-calamine was not produced but when the different
kinds of <i>cadmia</i>, as they were called, were melted; that is,
when yellow and not red copper was obtained. <i>Ofenbruch</i>
got the name of furnace-calamine at Rammelsberg, when it
was observed that it could be employed instead of native calamine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
for making <span class="locked">brass<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span>. Were the ancients then in any
measure acquainted with this use of it? Galen and Dioscorides
speak only of its use in medicine, and say nothing of its
being employed in the preparation of brass. The Arabian
writers, particularly the translators of the Greek physicians,
speak in a much clearer manner of the preparation of brass;
but the appellations which they employ are so indeterminate
in their signification, that an answer to the above question
cannot be deduced from them. <i>Climia</i>, which some pronounce
<i>calimia</i> and from which the modern Greeks made
<i>kelimia</i>, and the Latins <i>lapis calaminaris</i>, seems to have entirely
the same meaning as <i>cadmia</i>. <i>Tutia</i>, which occurs first
in the eleventh century, in Avicenna, and which the Greeks
write <i>toutia</i>, or perhaps more properly <i>thouthia</i>, signifies
sometimes <i>pompholyx</i>; but in common it seems to express
also minerals that contain zinc, and likewise <span class="locked">furnace-calamine<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span>.
Could it be proved that the <i>tutia</i> of the Arabs and
later Greeks was furnace-calamine, or the <i>tutia</i> of our druggists,
the oldest account with which I am acquainted of furnace-calamine,
employed in making brass, would occur in
Zosimus, who, according to every appearance, lived in the fifth
<span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>. This author tells us, that in order to make brass,
Cyprus copper must be melted, and pounded <i>tutia</i> must be
strewed over it. Salmasius suspects that Zosimus here means
only calamine: but however this may be, his receipt has been
retained till the present time in books on the arts; for these
recommend not calamine, but <i>tutia</i><a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>.</p>

<p>We can with more certainty affirm that this use of furnace-calamine,
in making brass, was known to Albertus Magnus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
in the thirteenth century; for he says, first, that yellow copper
was made by the addition of calamine, which he calls
<i>lapis calaminaris</i>. He tells us afterwards, that Hermes taught
how to give a gold colour to copper by throwing pounded
<i>tutia</i> into the melted metal. <i>Tutia</i>, says he, which is used in
the transmutation of metals, is not a native mineral, but an
artificial mixture, produced in the furnace when copper-ore
is melted; and he advises glass-gall to be strewed over the
ore, otherwise calamine and <i>tutia</i> will lose their force in the
<span class="locked">fire<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span>. It would appear that the last-mentioned name, in the
thirteenth century, signified only furnace-calamine, and that
its use for making brass was at that period known.</p>

<p>For many centuries, however, the <i>ofenbruch</i> (furnace-calamine),
with which, as we are told, the furnaces at Rammelsberg
overflowed, was thrown aside as useless, till at length, in
the middle of the sixteenth century, Erasmus Ebener first
showed that it might be used instead of native calamine for
making brass. This Ebener, descended from the noble family
of that name at Nuremberg, was a man of great learning, and
an able statesman. He was employed by his native city, and
by foreign princes, on occasions of the highest importance.
In 1569 he was privy-counsellor to Julius duke of Brunswick,
and died in 1577, at Helmstadt, where he was buried.
I regret much that I can give no further account of this important
discovery; the time even when it was made is not
known with certainty. Lœhneyss says that it was sixty years
before the period when he wrote. But at what period did he
write? The oldest edition, with which I am acquainted, of
his treatise on mines, is of the year 1617, so that this discovery
would fall about the year <span class="locked">1557<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span>. Calvör caused to be printed
an old account of the Rammelsberg mines, which was said
to have been published in 1565. According to that work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Ebener made the above-mentioned observation at Nuremberg,
about seventeen years before, that is, about the year 1548.
Schluter assigns as the period about 1550, and Honemann
about 1559. We may therefore very safely place it in the
middle of the sixteenth century, and probably the discovery
happened in 1553, at which time Ebener was sent to duke
Henry, with whom he continued a long time, as we are expressly
told by Doppelmayer. This use of calamine refuse
induced the managers of the profitable brass-works in the
Harz forest to pick up carefully that which before had been
thrown aside. Duke Julius, who endeavoured to improve
every branch of manufacture, and particularly what related
to metallurgy, and who, agreeably to the then prevailing
mode of princes, suffered himself to be duped with the hopes
of making gold, improved the brass-works at Buntheim, below
Harzburg, and by these means brought a great revenue
to the electoral treasury.</p>

<p>Another production of zinc, artificial white vitriol, was
also long prepared, used and employed in commerce before
it was known that it was procured from this metal. That it
was not known before the middle of the sixteenth century,
and that it was first made at Rammelsberg, may with confidence
be affirmed. Schluter ascribes the invention of it to
duke Julius, and places it in the year 1570: but it must be
somewhat older than the above-quoted account of Rammelsberg;
for the author, who wrote about <span class="locked">1565<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span>, relates, that in
his time one citizen only, whom he calls Henni Balder, boiled
white vitriol; and it appears that this person kept the process
a secret. That the invention was not then new, is evident
from his adding, that what its effects might be in medicine
had not been examined; but that its use in making eye-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
had been known almost as early as the time when it was
discovered. This agrees with another account, according
to which the method of boiling white vitriol was found out
at the time when Christopher Sander, whose service to the
Harz is well-known, was tithe-gatherer. Honemann says
that Sander was tithe-gatherer at the mines of the Upper
Harz before the year 1564, but that in this year he was
principal tithe-gatherer and director of the mines and melting-houses
at Goslar. Sander himself, in a paper dated
August 3, 1575, seems to ascribe the invention of white vitriol
to duke <span class="locked">Julius<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span>.</p>

<p>At first this salt was called <i>Erzalaun</i>, a name occasioned
by its likeness to alum, but afterwards it was more frequently
known by those of <i>Gallitzenstein</i>, <i>Golitzenstein</i>, and <i>Calitzenstein</i>.
The latter names however appear to be older than
white vitriol itself; as we find that green vitriol, even before
the year 1565, was called green <i>Gallitzenstein</i>. May not the
word be derived from <i>gallæ</i>; because it is probable that
vitriol and galls were for a long time the principal articles
used for making ink and in dyeing? I am of opinion that
the white vitriol, which is produced in the mines of Rammelsberg
in the form of icicles, gave rise to the discovery and
manufacture of this salt. The former, so early as the year
1565, was called white native vitriol, or white <i>Gogkelgut</i>, and
was packed up in casks, and in that manner transported for
<span class="locked">sale<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span>. I shall not here enter into the old conjectures respecting
the origin and component parts of this vitriol; but it deserves
to be remarked, that Henkel and <span class="locked">Neumann<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> observed
in it a mixture of zinc, by which Brandt, a member of the
Swedish council of mines, was led to prove, that, when pure,
it consists of vitriolic acid and oxide of zinc; and this was
afterwards confirmed by <span class="locked">Hellot<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
I come now, in the last place, to the history of this metal,
which, when furnace-calamine was used, could not remain
long unobserved, as it is sometimes found amongst it uncalcined
in metallic drops. It is worthy of remark, that Albertus
Magnus, who first described the use of furnace-calamine in
making brass, is the oldest author in whose works mention is
made of zinc. He calls it <i>marchasita aurea</i>. This was properly
a stone, the metallic particles of which were so entirely
sublimated by fire, that nothing but useless ashes remained
behind. It contained fixed quicksilver, communicated a
colour to metals, on which account it was well known to the
alchemists, burned in the fire, and was at length entirely consumed.
It was found in various parts, but that at Goslar was
the best, because the copper it contained seemed to have in
it a mixture of gold. To give this copper however a still
greater resemblance to gold, some tin was added to it, by
which means it became more brittle. This marchasita also
rendered copper white as silver. Thus far Albertus. It obtained
without doubt the name of <i>marchasita aurea</i>, because
zinc communicates a yellow colour to copper; and for the
same reason the Greeks and the Arabians called <i>cadmia</i>
golden or <i>aurea</i>. But how could Albertus say that marchasite
made copper white? Did he commit a mistake, and
mean tin? To me this appears not probable, as at one time
he seems to call it <i>argentea</i>. I imagine that he knew that
copper, when mixed with as much zinc as possible, that is,
according to Scheffer, eighty-nine pounds to a hundred, became
white; and it appears that by this he wished to establish
its affinity with quicksilver.</p>

<p>The next author who gives an intelligible account of this
metal is Theophrastus Paracelsus, who died in 1541. I do
not however imagine that it was forgotten in this long interval,
at least by those who were called alchemists. I am rather
of opinion, that on account of the great hopes which it gave
them by the colouring of copper, they described it purposely
in an obscure manner, and concealed it under other names,
so that it was not discovered in their works. There are few
who would have patience to wade through these, and the few
who could do so, turn their attention to objects of greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
importance than those which occupy mine. Gold and silver
excepted, there is no metal which has had formerly so many
and so wonderful names as <span class="locked">zinc<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span>. For this reason, chemists
long believed that zinc was not a distinct metal, but only a
variety of tin or bismuth; and with these perhaps it may
hence have been often confounded.</p>

<p>The name zinc occurs first in Paracelsus. He expressly
calls it a distinct metal, the nature of which was not sufficiently
known; which could be cast, but was not malleable,
and which was produced only in Carinthia. Was he then
unacquainted with the zinc of Goslar, which was known at
an earlier period to Albertus <span class="locked">Magnus<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span>? George Agricola,
who wrote about the year 1550, speaks however of the Goslar
zinc, but he calls it <i>liquor candidus</i>, and in German <i>conterfey</i><a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>.
Mathesius, who published his sermons in 1562, says, “at
Freyberg there is red and white zinc.” Perhaps he did not
mean the metal, but minerals that contained zinc. George
Fabricius, who died in 1571, conjectures that <i>stibium</i> is what
the miners call <i>cincum</i>, which can be melted, but not hammered.</p>

<p>It is seen by these imperfect accounts that this metal must
have been scarce, even in the middle of the sixteenth century,
and that it was not in the collection of Agricola, which
was considerable for that period. Libavius, who died in
1616, mentions it several times, but he regrets, in one of his
letters, that he had not been able to procure any of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span>. Was
this owing to the prohibition of duke Julius, by which it was
forbidden to be sold? This prohibition is quoted by Pott
from Jungii Mineralogia, with which I am unacquainted; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
as Pott has already, by his unintelligible quotations, made
me spend many hours to no purpose, I shall not waste more
in searching for it. The prohibition alluded to is mentioned
neither by Rehtmeier nor by any other author. The foolish
taste for alchemy, which prevailed then at the duke’s court,
makes it not altogether improbable that one was <span class="locked">issued<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span>;
and if that was really the case, it was occasioned not so much
by any dread of this metal being misused, as Pott thinks, but
by the high hopes which were entertained of its utility in
making gold. The first accurate and certain account of the
method of procuring zinc at Goslar, is, as far as I know, given
by Lœhneyss, in 1617, though he considers it to be the same
as <span class="locked">bismuth<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span>. Joh. Schrœder of Westphalia, who died in
1664, calls it <i>marcasita pallida</i>.</p>

<p>The first person who purposely procured this metal from
calamine, by the addition of some inflammable substance, was
undoubtedly Henkel, who gave an account of his success in
the year 1741, though he concealed the whole <span class="locked">process<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span>.
After him, Dr. Isaac Lawson, a Scotsman, seems to have
made experiments which proved the possibility of obtaining
zinc in this manner on a large scale; and in 1737 Henkel
heard that it was then manufactured in England with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
advantage. Of this Lawson I know nothing more than what
is related by Dr. <span class="locked">Watson<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span>. Anthony von Swab, member of
the Swedish council of mines, procured this metal afterwards
from calamine by distillation, in 1742; as did Marggraf in
1746, who appears however not to have been acquainted with
the Swedish experiment. In the year 1743, one Champion
established zinc works at Bristol, which were continued by
his successor James Emerson, who established works of the
like kind at Henham, in the neighbourhood. The manner in
which the metal was procured, has been described by Dr.
Watson in his Chemical Essays.</p>

<p>The greater part of this metal, used in Europe, was undoubtedly
brought from the East Indies. The Commercial
Company in the Netherlands, between the years 1775 and
1779, caused to be sold, on their account, above 943,081
pounds of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span>. In the year 1780, the chamber of Rotterdam
alone sold 28,000 pounds; and I find, by printed catalogues,
that the other chambers, at that period, had not any of it in
their possession. If the account given by Raynal be true,
the Dutch East India Company purchased annually, at Palimbang,
a million and a half of <span class="locked">pounds<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span>. In 1781, the Danish
Company at Copenhagen purchased 153,953 pounds of
tutenage, which had been carried thither in two vessels, at
the rate of from four and one-eighth to four and a quarter
schillings Lubec per pound. It is probable that the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
and Swedes import this article also. It would be of some
consequence if one could learn in what part of India, when,
and in what manner this metal was first procured, and in what
year it was first carried thence to Europe. According to the
scanty information which we have on the subject, it comes
from China, Bengal, <span class="locked">Malacca<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span>, and the Malabar coast, from
which copper and tin are also imported. In the oldest bills
of lading of ships belonging to the Netherlands I find no mention
of zinc; but it is possible that it may be comprehended
under the name of Indian tin; for so it was at first called.
Savot, who died about the year 1640, relates, on the authority
of a contemporary <span class="locked">writer<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span>, that some years before the
Dutch had taken from the Portuguese a ship laden with this
metal, which was sold under the name of <i>speautre</i>. It is probable
therefore that it was brought to Europe so early as the
beginning of the seventeenth century. Indian tin is mentioned
by Boyle.</p>

<p>It is probable that this metal was discovered in India before
anything of the European zinc had been known in that
country; but we are still less acquainted with the cause of
the discovery than with the method of procuring the metal.
We are told that an Englishman, who, in the above century,
went to India, in order to discover the process used there, returned
with an account that it was obtained by distillation
<i>ver descensum</i>.</p>

<p>Respecting the origin of the different names of this metal,
I can offer very little. <i>Conterfey</i> signified formerly every
kind of metal made in imitation of <span class="locked">gold<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span>. Frisch says it was
called <i>zink</i>, from which was formed first <i>zinetum</i>, and afterwards
<i>zincum</i>, because the furnace-calamine assumes the
figure of (<i>zinken</i> or <i>zacken</i>) nails or spikes; but it is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
remarked that these names do not occur before the discovery
of this metal, though <i>ofenbruch</i> was known long before. Fulda
speaks of the Anglo-Saxon <i>sin</i>, <i>zink</i>, which he translates
<i>obryzum</i>. <i>Spiauter</i>, <i>speauter</i>, and <i>spialter</i>, from which Boyle
made <i>speltrum</i>, and also <i>tutaneg</i> or <i>tuttanego</i>, came to us from
India with the commodity. Under the last-mentioned name
is sometimes comprehended a mixture of tin and bismuth.
<i>Calaem</i> is also an Indian appellation given to this metal, and
has a considerable likeness to calamine; but I am of opinion
with Salmasius that the latter is not derived from the former,
as <i>lapis calaminaris</i> occurs in the thirteenth century, and
<i>calaem</i> was first brought to us by the Portuguese from India.</p>

<p>[Most of the zinc works in this country are situated in the
neighbourhood of Birmingham and Bristol; a few furnaces
also exist in the neighbourhood of Sheffield, among the coal-pits
surrounding that town; there is also one at Maestag in
Glamorganshire. The ores worked at Bristol and Birmingham
are principally obtained from the Mendip-hills and
Flintshire; those at Sheffield from Alston Moor. The
greater part however of the zinc used in this country is imported
in ingots and plates from Silesia, by way of Hamburg,
Antwerp, Dantzic, &amp;c. We receive annually from 100,000
to 170,000 cwts. from Germany; of this quantity, about
80,000 cwt. are entered for home consumption, and the rest
is exported for India.</p>

<p>From its moderate price and the ease with which it can be
worked, zinc is now extensively used for making water-cisterns,
baths, pipes, covering of roofs, and a great many architectural
purposes. It has also of late been employed in the
curious art of transferring printing, known under the name
of <i>Zincography</i>, but owing to the ease with which this metal
becomes coated with a film of oxide or carbonate, by exposure
to the air, the plates cannot be preserved for any great
length of time.]</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> At first it was called <i>æs cyprium</i>, but in the course of time only <i>cyprium</i>;
from which was at length formed <i>cuprum</i>. It cannot however be
ascertained at what periods these appellations were common. The epithet
<i>cupreus</i> occurs in manuscripts of Pliny and Palladius; but one cannot say
whether later transcribers may not have changed <i>cyprius</i> into <i>cupreus</i>,
with which they were perhaps better acquainted. The oldest writer who
uses the word <i>cuprum</i> is Spartian; who says, in the Life of Caracalla,
“cancelli ex ære vel cupro.” But may not the last word have been added
to the text as a gloss? Pliny, book xxxvi. 26, says, “Addito cyprio et
nitro;” which Isidore, xvi. 15, p. 393, expresses by the words <i>adjecto cupro
et nitro</i>. The superiority of the Cyprian copper gave occasion to this
appellation; as the best iron or steel was called <i>chalybs</i>, from the <i>Chalybes</i>
(a people of Galatia) who prepared the finest, and carried on the greatest
trade with it. But in what did the superiority of this Cyprian copper
consist? In its purity, or in its colour, which approached near to that of
gold? That island produced a great deal of ore which contained zinc,
and abounded also with calamine. Pliny says, “in Cypro prima fuit æris
inventio.” Red copper however had been known there from the earliest
periods, so that the honour of its invention must be allowed to that island
without any contradiction; and Pliny must undoubtedly allude in the
above passage to some particular kind.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_87" id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Dioscorides, book v. c. 84, first mentions some sorts of <i>cadmia</i>, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βοτρυίτις</span>,
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πλακωτὴ</span> and <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ὀστρακῖτις</span>. These, according to Galen and Pliny,
are undoubtedly certain kinds of (<i>ofenbruch</i>) furnace-calamine; but Salmasius
in his book De Homonymis, p. 230, and Sarracen in his Annotations,
p. 113, are of opinion that Dioscorides considered them as native kinds of
<i>cadmia</i>, or minerals abundant in zinc. I cannot however allow myself to
believe that Dioscorides, who was so careful, and who immediately after
describes the artificial preparation of <i>cadmia</i> clearly and properly, should
have thus erred. Besides, every kind of <i>ofenbruch</i> (furnace-calamine)
must have discovered its origin from fire to such a good judge of minerals
as Dioscorides. I am convinced that he, as well as Galen and Pliny, considered
the above kinds as furnace-calamine.
</p>
<p>
Pompholyx was the name of the white flowers of zinc which Dioscorides,
v. 85, p. 352, compares to wool, and which by chemists were formerly
called <i>lana philosophica</i>. The ancients collected these flowers when
produced by the melting of zinc-ore; but they obtained them also by an
apparatus which is fully described by Dioscorides and Galen, and which
approaches near to that used for collecting arsenic in the poison melting-houses,
as they are usually called.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> This however I will not with certainty affirm. As <i>calmey</i> and <i>galmey</i>
have probably taken their rise from <i>cadmia</i> or <i>calimia</i>, and as both these
words signified proper calamine, as well as <i>ofenbruch</i>, the latter, perhaps,
may at an earlier period have signified furnace-calamine.</p></div>

<h2 id="carp">CARP.</h2>

<p>So obscure is the ichthyology of the ancients, or so little care
has been taken to explain it, that the question whether our
carp were known to Aristotle, Pliny, and their contemporaries,
cannot with any great degree of probability be determined.
Besides, that subject is attended with much greater difficulties
than the natural history of quadrupeds. Among four-footed
animals there is a greater variety in their bodily conformation,
which at any rate strikes the eye more, and can
be more easily described than that of fishes, which in general
are so like in shape, that an experienced systematic naturalist
finds it sometimes difficult to determine the characters of
the genera and species. It is not surprising therefore that the
simple descriptions of the ancients, or rather the short accounts
which they give us of fish, do not afford information
sufficient to enable us to distinguish with accuracy the different
kinds. Quadrupeds may terrify us by their ferocity,
or endeavour to avoid us by shyness and craft; but it is still
possible to observe their sexes, their age, and their habits,
and to remark many things that are common to one or only
a few species. Fishes, on the other hand, live in an element
in which we cannot approach them, and which for the most
part conceals them from our observation. The chase, since
the earliest periods, and in modern times more than formerly,
has been the employment of idle persons, who bestow upon
it greater attention the fewer those objects are which can attract
their curiosity or employ their minds: but fishing has
almost always been the laborious occupation of poor people,
who have no time to make observations, as they are obliged
to follow it in order to find a subsistence; and mankind in
general seldom see fish except on their tables or in collections
of natural history. On this account those properties of fish
by which their species could be determined, were less known.
The descriptions of four-footed animals which have been
handed down to us from the time of the Greek and Roman
writers, give us, at any rate, some information; but from those
of fishes, which are more uncommon, we can scarcely derive
any; unless one were as acute or easy of belief as many collectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of petrefactions, who imagine that they can distinguish
each species of fish in the impressions which they see in stones.
More however might be done towards elucidating the ichthyology
of the ancients than has hitherto been attempted. It
would be necessary only to make a beginning by collecting
the species and names which can with certainty be determined,
together with the authorities, and separating them
from the rest; and an abstract should be formed of what is
said in the ancients respecting the unknown species, or whatever
may in any measure serve to make us acquainted with
them; but mere conjectures ought never to be given as
proofs, nor ought the opinions of commentators, or the explanations
of dictionaries to be adopted without sufficient
grounds. If these are to be believed without further examination,
the names <i>cyprini</i> and <i>lepidoti</i> must be considered
as those of carp; and the proposed question would be soon
answered: but that opinion has scarcely probability in its
favour when one searches after proofs.</p>

<p>I shall not here lay before the reader everything completely
that the ancients have said respecting the <i>cyprini</i>, and
which is in part so corrupted by transcribers, that no certain
meaning can be drawn from it. Were I to treat of the ichthyology
of the ancients, it might be necessary; but as that
is not the case, I shall only quote such parts of it as have
been employed by Rondelet and others to prove that they
were our carp. Their principal grounds seem to be, that
among all the fish of the ancients no others occur which can
with any probability be considered as carp. If the <i>cyprini</i>
therefore were not carp, these must not have been named by
the ancients; and that undoubtedly will not readily be admitted.
It is well known what a high value the ancients,
particularly the Orientals, set upon fish, of which they had a
great variety; and it appears that they preferred them to all
dishes prepared from four-footed animals or fowls. Fish
seem to have been the choicest delicacies of voluptuaries, and
in that respect they are oftener mentioned by historians than
fowls. Physicians also, to whom the most sumptuous tables
have in all ages been of the greatest benefit, speak of fish
oftener in their writings than of dishes made of the flesh of
other animals. In the ancient cookery, the number of dishes
prepared from fish is indeed great in comparison of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
dressed from fowls. <i>Turdi</i> and <i>attagines</i> are much praised;
but had pheasants, snipes, partridges, and others, been as
much esteemed then as they are now, these would not have
been forgotten, or would have occurred oftener. Fish at
present form the principal food in Greece, as well as at Constantinople,
and a great abundance and variety of them may
be found there in the markets; but fowls which have been
caught or shot are seldom exposed for sale. When the
Egyptian and Greek monks wished to distinguish themselves
by abstinence and temperance, they denied themselves all
kinds of fish, as the richest delicacies, in the same manner as
pretended devotees among the Europeans deny themselves
flesh. But though all this may be true, it does not prove
that our carp must occur in the writings of the ancients. The
Roman voluptuaries, indeed, left very little untried that was
likely to gratify their appetite; but it was impossible for them
to make a trial of everything. There may have been particular
reasons which prevented them from meeting with carp;
and who will venture to affirm that all the knowledge of the
ancients must be contained in those few of their writings which
have been preserved to us by accidents?</p>

<p>If one, freed from these prejudices, should now ask why
the <i>cyprinus</i> must be our carp, the answer will be, because
what we read of the tongue and scales of the <i>cyprini</i> cannot
be applied with so much propriety to any species of fish as to
the <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> of Linnæus. Aristotle informs us that
the <i>cyprini</i> had properly no tongue, but that their soft fleshy
palate might very readily be taken for <span class="locked">one<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span>. Athenæus
affirms that they had a tongue, but that it lay in the upper
part of the mouth or palate; and in confirmation of this he
refers to <span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span>. This assertion of Athenæus however is
very dubious; for these words are not to be found in the
works of Aristotle which have been preserved, though the
same meaning might be indeed forced, in case of necessity,
from the passage first quoted. It is possible that Athenæus,
as <span class="locked">Casaubon<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> has already conjectured, may here, as well as
in other parts, allude to some book of Aristotle not now extant.
Besides, he calls the fish of which he speaks, not <i>cyprinus</i>,
but <i>cyprianus</i>; and a question therefore arises, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
he may not have meant some other kind. This much at
any rate appears certain from the passage of Aristotle, that
the <i>cyprinus</i> had a thick fleshy palate; and that indeed is
the case with our carp, so that the head, on account of the
delicacy and agreeable taste of the palate, is reckoned the
most relishing part. By that circumstance however nothing
is proved; as it is not peculiar to carp alone, but common to
every species of the same family, such as the bream, tench,
&amp;c. Fish of this kind, says Bloch, have properly no tongue;
that which appears to be one is merely a cartilaginous substance
which projects through those band-like parts that enclose
it on each side. This proof would have more weight,
did we find it related, that in the time of Aristotle, the tongue
was considered as an exquisite morsel: but that is not mentioned;
and H. Krunitz is mistaken, when he says that Heliogabalus,
to satisfy his luxurious appetite, was induced to
try a fricassee of the tongues of carp: it consisted only of
the tongues of peacocks and <span class="locked">nightingales<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span>. Had the ancients
really used carp on their tables, we must have ascribed to
them the discovery of these delicious fish.</p>

<p>The other proof which is brought from the scales consists
in what is said by Dorion, in Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>, that the <i>cyprianus</i>
was called also by some <i>lepidotus</i>, or scaly. As nearly all fish
have scales, the scales of this species must have been extremely
large, as they got that name by way of eminence; and
it must be indeed allowed, that the above epithet would suit
our carp exceedingly well, as their scales are very large.
But this circumstance alone proves nothing, as the <i>Mullus</i>
and <i>Mugil</i> have still larger scales; and to the first genus belonged
one of the fish most esteemed by the <span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span>. Strabo
mentions the <i>lepidotus</i> among the sacred fish of the Nile; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
whether it be the same as that of which Dorion speaks, cannot
be determined. It is certain that the Nile contains
carp still; for Norden saw them caught at the waterfall near
Essuane, which is the ancient Syene. Did we know that
the modern Greeks at present call carp <i>cyprini</i>, this would
prove more; for it is an undoubted fact that the ancient
names have for the most part been retained in Greece. We
are assured by <span class="locked">Massarius<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span>, that the Greeks still use the name
<i>cyprinus</i>; but Gyllius says that it is employed only by a
few: and this is confirmed by Bellon, who mentions all the
names of carp which he heard in Greece, and which are entirely
different from the <span class="locked">ancient<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span>; but he adds, that carp in
Ætolia are still called <i>cyprini</i>. Both the before-mentioned
circumstances respecting the <i>cyprini</i> agree extremely well
with our carp; but as they will suit other kinds equally well,
they afford no complete proof, but only a probability which
amounts to this, that among the large-scaled fish, carp in
particular have a fleshy palate; and it is readily admitted
that the ancients were acquainted with all kinds, and chose
names for them with more foundation than is done at present.</p>

<p>In opposition to this probability it may be said that Oppian
and Pliny reckon the <i>cyprini</i> among the sea-fish, to which
kind our carp do not belong. This reply however, which some
have indeed made, is not of great weight. In the first place,
both these writers seem to have been in an error; for what
Pliny says of the <i>cyprini</i> is evidently taken from Aristotle, and
the latter does not tell us that these fish live in the sea, but
rather the contrary. The Roman author, as Dalechamp remarks,
added the words <i>in mari</i>, if they were not added by
some transcriber. Oppian as a poet does not always adhere
strictly to truth; and he makes more of the freshwater fish
of Aristotle to be inhabitants of the sea. In the second place,
I consider the distinction made between sea-fish, freshwater
fish and those kept in ponds, to be not always very certain or
well founded. Who knows whether the greater part of the
last may not have been originally sea-fish? This is the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
probable in regard to carp, as Professor Foster says that carp
are sometimes caught in the harbour at <span class="locked">Dantzic<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span>.</p>

<p>In order to answer the question here proposed, another point
may be considered. As all nations at present give these fish
the same name, it is probable that it was brought with them
from that country where they were first found, and from
which they were procured. Cassiodorus, who lived in the
sixth century, is the oldest author as yet known in whom that
name has been <span class="locked">observed<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span>. In a passage where he speaks of
the most delicate and costly fish, which at that time were sent
to the tables of princes, he says, “Among these is the <i>carpa</i>,
which is produced in the Danube.” In the earliest Latin
translation of Aristotle, the word <i>cyprinus</i>, as Camus says, is
expressed by <i>carpra</i>. In the thirteenth century this fish was
called by Vincentius de <span class="locked">Beauvais<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> <i>carpera</i>, and by Cæsarius
<i>carpo</i>; and it is highly probable that both these names allude
to our carp. By the above passage of Cassiodorus, the opinion
that these fish were the <i>cyprini</i> of the ancients obtains a
new, but at the same time a very feeble proof; for the <i>cyprinus</i>
was found also in the Danube, as we learn from Ælian<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>, who
among the fish of the Ister, mentions black <i>cyprini</i>; and
these, according to the conjecture of Professor Schneider,
were the black fish of the Danube which Pliny considers as
unhealthful or poisonous, and like which there were some in
Armenia. Our carp indeed are not poisonous, but Pliny
alludes to a particular variety, and what he says was only report,
to which something must have given rise, as also to
the idea of carp with a death’s head, and the head of a pug-dog,
as some have been represented by writers of the sixteenth
century. The <i>carpo</i> of Cæsarius appears to have been
our carp, because its scales had a very great resemblance to
those of the latter; for we are told in the work already
quoted, that the devil, once indulging in a frolic, appeared in
a coat of mail, and had scales like the fish <i>carpo</i>. The <i>carpera</i>
of Vincent de Beauvais is still less doubtful, as the same
craft in avoiding rakes and nets is ascribed to that fish as is
known to be employed by our carp. Sometimes they thrust
their heads into the mud and suffer the net to pass over them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and sometimes they join the head and tail together, and separating
them suddenly, throw themselves towards the surface
of the water, and springing often four or five feet above the
net, make their escape.</p>

<p>But whence did this name arise? The origin assigned by
Vincentius, or the anonymous author of the lost books De
Natura Rerum, like another mentioned in ridicule by Gesner,
is too silly to be repeated. More learned at any rate is the
derivation of Menage, who traces it from <i>cyprinus</i>, which was
afterwards transformed into <i>cuprinus</i>, <i>cuprius</i>, <i>cuprus</i>, <i>cupra</i>,
<i>curpa</i>, and lastly into <i>carpa</i>. For my part, I am more inclined
to derive it from a dialect which was spoken on the
banks of the Danube, and to believe that it was brought with
the fish from the southern part of Europe; but I am too little
acquainted with that dialect to be able to render my conjecture
very probable; and the etymologists I consulted, such
as Wachter, Ihre, Johnson, &amp;c., afforded me no assistance.
Fulda gave me some hopes, as he allows the word to be of
German extraction; but I must confess that his derivation is
too far-fetched, and like the chemistry of the adepts, to me
not perfectly intelligible.</p>

<p>It may perhaps not be superfluous here to observe that one
must not confound <i>carpa</i> and <i>carpo</i>, or our carp, with <i>carpio</i>.
The latter belongs to the genus of the salmon and trout; and
in the Linnæan system is called <i>Salmo carpio</i>. It is found
chiefly in the Lago di Garda, the ancient Lacus Benacus, on
the confines of Tyrol. The oldest account of this fish is to
be found in works of the sixteenth century, such as the poems
of Pierius Valerianus, and in Jovius de Piscibus. According
to Linnæus, it is found in the rivers of England; but that is
false. This celebrated naturalist suffered himself to be misled
by Artedi, who gives the char or chare, mentioned by
Camden in his description of Lancashire, as the <i>Salmo carpio</i>.
Pennant however, by whom it is not mentioned among the
English fish, says expressly that the char is not the <i>carpio</i> of
the Lago di Garda, but rather a variety of the <i>Salmo alpinus</i><a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>.</p>

<p>That our carp were first found in the southern parts of
Europe, and conveyed thence to other countries, is undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
certain. Even at present they do not thrive in the northern
regions, and the further north they are carried the smaller
they <span class="locked">become<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span>. Some accounts of their transportation are
still to be found. If it be true that the Latin poem on the
expedition of Attila is as old as the fifth or sixth century, and
if the fish which Walther gave to the boatman who ferried
him over the Rhine, and which the latter carried to the
kitchen of Gunther king of the Franks, were carp, this circumstance
is a proof that these fish had not been before
known in that part of France which bordered on the <span class="locked">Rhine<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span>.
The examination of this conjecture I shall however leave to
others. D’Aussy quotes a book never printed, of the thirteenth
century, entitled Proverbes, and in which is given an
account of the best articles produced at that time by the different
parts of the kingdom, and assures us that a great many
kinds of fish were mentioned in it, but no carp, though at
present they are common all over France.</p>

<p>It appears also that there were no carp in England in the
eleventh century, at least they do not occur in the Anglo-Saxon
Dictionary of Ælfric, who in 1051 died archbishop
of <span class="locked">York<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span>. We are assured likewise that they were first
brought into the kingdom in the fifth year of the reign of
Henry VIII., or in 1514, by Leonard Mascal of Plumsted in
<span class="locked">Sussex<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span>. What we read in the Linnæan System, that these
fish were first brought to England about the year 1600, is
certainly erroneous. Where that celebrated naturalist, under
whom I had the pleasure of studying, acquired this information,
I do not know.</p>

<p>Denmark is indebted for these fish to that celebrated statesman
Peter Oxe, who introduced them into the kingdom as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
well as cray-fish, and other objects for the table. He died in
the year 1575.</p>

<p>We are told that these fish were brought from Italy to
Prussia, where they are at present very abundant, by a nobleman
whose name is not mentioned. This service however
may be ascribed with more probability to the upper burg-grave,
Caspar von Nostiz, who died in 1588, and who in the
middle of the sixteenth century first sent carp to Prussia from
his estate in Silesia, and caused them to be put into the large
pond at Arensberg not far from Creuzburg. As a memorial
of this circumstance, the figure of a carp, cut in stone, was
shown formerly over a door at the castle of Arensberg. This
colony must have been very numerous in the year 1535, for
at that period carp were sent from Königsberg to Wilda,
where the archduke Albert then resided. At present (1798)
a great many carp are transported from Dantzic and Königsberg
to Russia, Sweden, and Denmark. It appears to me
probable that these fish after that period became everywhere
known and esteemed, as eating fish in Lent and on fast-days
was among Christians considered to be a religious duty, and
that on this account they endeavoured to have ponds stocked
with them in every country, because no species can be so
easily bred in these reservoirs.</p>

<p>I shall observe in the last place, that the <i>Spiegel-carpen</i>,
mirror-carp, distinguished by yellow scales, which are much
larger, though fewer in number, and which do not cover the
whole body, are not mentioned but by modern writers. Bloch
says that they were first described by Johnston under the
name of royal carp. The passage where he does so I cannot
find; but in plate xxix. there is a bad engraving, with the
title <i>Spiegel-karpen</i>, which however have scales all over their
bodies, and cannot be the kind alluded to. On the other
hand, the <i>Spiegel-karpen</i> are mentioned by Gesner, who, as
it appears, never saw them. In my opinion, Balbinus, who
wrote in the middle of the sixteenth century, was the first
person who gave a true and complete description of them;
and according to his account, they seem to have come originally
from Bohemia. The first correct figure of them is to
be found in Marsigli.</p>

<h2 id="camp">CAMP-MILLS.</h2>

<p>Under this appellation are understood portable or moveable
mills, which can be used, particularly in the time of war,
when there are neither wind- nor water-mills in the neighbourhood,
and which on that account formerly accompanied
armies in the same manner as camp-ovens and camp-forges.
Some of these mills have stones for grinding the corn, and
others are constructed with a notched roller like those of our
coffee-mills. Some of them also are so contrived that the
machinery is put in motion by the revolution of the wheels
of the carriage on which they are placed; and others, and
perhaps the greater part of those used, are driven by horses
or men, after the wheels of the carriage are sunk in the ground,
or fastened in some other manner.</p>

<p>To the latter kind belongs that mill of which <span class="locked">Zonca<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> has
given a coarse engraving, but without any description. He
says it was invented by Pompeo Targone, engineer to the
well-known marquis Ambrose Spinola; and he seems to place
the time of the invention about the end of the sixteenth century.
This mill is the same as that described by Beyer in
his Theatrum Machinarum Molarium, and represented in the
twenty-seventh plate of that <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span>. Beyer remarks that it
was employed by Spinola.</p>

<p>The inventor, as his name shows, was an Italian, who made
himself known, in particular, at the celebrated siege of Rochelle,
under Louis XIII., at which he was chosen to assist,
because in the year 1603, when with Spinola, who was consulted
respecting the operations at Rochelle, he had helped
by means of a mole to shut the harbour of Ostend during the
tedious siege of that place. He was likewise in the French
service, as <i>intendant des machines du roi</i>; but his numerous
and expensive undertakings did not succeed according to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<span class="locked">expectations<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span>. He invented also a particular kind of gun-carriages,
and a variety of warlike <span class="locked">machines<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span>.</p>

<p>Another old figure of such a mill was shown to me by Professor
Meister, in Recueil de Plusieurs Machines Militaires,
printed in 1620. This machine was driven by the wheels of
the carriage; but whether it was ever used the author does
not inform us.</p>

<p>Lancellotti<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> ascribes this invention to the Germans, about
the year 1633.</p>

<p>Carriages for transporting camp-forges and mill-machinery
are mentioned by Leonard <span class="locked">Fronsperger<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span>, but he does not say
whether complete mills were affixed to them.</p>

<h2 id="mirrors" title="MIRRORS">MIRRORS<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor smaller">135</a>.</h2>

<p>It is highly probable that a limpid brook was the first <span class="locked">mirror<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
but we have reason to think that artificial mirrors were made
as mankind began to exercise their art and ingenuity on
metals and stones. Every solid body, capable of receiving a
fine polish, would be sufficient for this purpose; and indeed
the oldest mirrors mentioned in history were of metal. Those
which occur in <span class="locked">Job<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span> are praised on account of their hardness
and solidity; and Moses <span class="locked">relates<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span>, that the brazen laver, or
washing-basin, was made from the mirrors of the women
who had assembled at the door of the tabernacle to present
them, and which he caused them to deliver up. As the women
appeared in full dress at divine worship, it was necessary
for them to have looking-glasses after the Egyptian manner.
With these the washing-basins, according to the conjecture of
most interpretators, were only ornamented, covered, or perhaps
hung round; and <span class="locked">Michaelis<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span> himself was once of this opinion.
But why should we not rather believe that the mirrors were
melted and formed into washing-basins? As soon as mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
began to endeavour to make good mirrors of metal, they
must have remarked that every kind of metal was not equally
proper for that use, and that the best could be obtained only
from a mixture of different metals. In the mirrors however
which were collected by Moses, the artists had a sufficient stock
of speculum metal, and were not under the necessity of making
it themselves; and for this reason they could much more
easily give to the whole basin a polished surface, in which
the priests, when they washed, might survey themselves at
full length. At any rate such a basin would not be the only
one employed instead of a mirror. <span class="locked">Artemidorus<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> says that
he who dreams of viewing himself in a basin, will have a son
born to him by his maid. Dreams indeed are generally as
groundless as this interpretation; but one can hardly conjecture
that Artemidorus would have thought of such a
dream, had it not been very common for people to contemplate
themselves in a basin. There were formerly a kind of
fortune-tellers, who pretended to show in polished basins to
the simple and ignorant, what they wished to <span class="locked">know<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span>. The
ancients also had drinking-vessels, the inside of which was
cut into mirrors, so disposed that the image of the person
who drank from them was seen <span class="locked">multiplied<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span>. Vopiscus mentions,
among the valuable presents of Valerian to the emperor
Probus, when a tribune, a silver cup of great weight,
which was covered on the inside with mirrors of this <span class="locked">sort<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Menard and others conjecture that mirrors in the time of
Homer were not much used, because he mentions them on
no occasion, not even where he describes in so circumstantial
a manner the toilet of <span class="locked">Juno<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span>. In answer to this, however, I
have two things to observe. In the first place, it is not to be
expected that Homer should have mentioned every article
with which he was acquainted; and secondly, we are assured
by Callimachus, where he evidently has imitated the passage
of Homer <span class="locked">before-quoted<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span>, that neither Juno nor Pallas employed
a mirror when they dressed. Mythology therefore did
not allow the poet to introduce a mirror upon the toilet of
that deity. Polydore Vergilius, Boccace, Menard, and others
have all fallen into the error of making Æsculapius the inventor
of mirrors, though <span class="locked">Cicero<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> seems to say the same
thing; but the best commentators have long since observed
very justly, that the Roman philosopher alludes not to a mirror
but to a probe, the invention of which we may allow to
the father of medicine, who was at first only a surgeon.</p>

<p>When one reflects upon the use made of metal mirrors, particularly
at Rome, to add to magnificence and for other purposes,
and how many artists, during many successive centuries, were
employed in constructing them, and vied to excel each other
in their art, one cannot help conjecturing that this branch of
business must at those periods have been carried to a high
degree of perfection. It is therefore to be regretted that
they have not been particularly described by any writer, and
that on this account the art was entirely lost after the invention
of glass mirrors, which are much more convenient. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
one at that time entertained the least suspicion that circumstances
would afterwards occur which would render these
metal mirrors again necessary, as has been the case in our
days by the invention of the telescope. Our artists then were
obliged to make new experiments in order to discover the
best mixture for mirrors of metal; and this should be a warning
to mankind, never to suffer arts which have been once
invented and useful to become again unknown. A circumstantial
description of them should at any rate be preserved
for the use of posterity, in libraries, the archives of human
knowledge.</p>

<p>When we compare metals in regard to their fitness for mirrors,
we shall soon perceive that the hardest of a white colour
possess in the highest degree the necessary lustre. For this
reason platina is preferable to all others, as is proved from
the experiments made by the Count von Sickengen. Steel
approaches nearest to this new metal, and silver follows steel;
but gold, copper, tin and lead, are much less endowed with
the requisite property. I have however observed among the
ancients no traces of steel mirrors; and it is probable they
did not make any of that metal, as it is so liable to become
tarnished, or to contract rust. An ancient steel-mirror is
indeed said to have been once found, but as some marks of
silvering were perceived on it, a question arises whether the
silvered side was not properly the face of the <span class="locked">mirror<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span>. Besides,
every person knows that a steel mirror would not retain
its lustre many centuries amidst ruins and rubbish.</p>

<p>The greater part of the ancient mirrors were made of silver,
not on account of costliness and magnificence, as many think,
but because silver, as has been said, was the fittest and the
most durable of all the then known unmixed metals for that
use. In the Roman code of laws, when silver plate is mentioned,
under the heads of heirship and succession by propinquity,
silver mirrors are rarely omitted; and <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span>, <span class="locked">Seneca<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span>,
and other writers, who inveigh against luxury, tell us, ridiculing
the extravagance of the age, that every young woman
in their time must have a silver mirror. These polished silver
plates may however have been very slight, for all the ancient
mirrors, preserved in collections, which I have ever seen, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
only covered with a thin coat of that expensive metal; and in
the like manner our artists have at length learned a method
of making the cases of gold and silver watches so thin and
light, that every footman and soldier can wear one. At first
the finest silver only was employed for these mirrors, because
it was imagined that they could not be made of that which
was standard; but afterwards metal was used of an inferior
quality. Pliny tells us so expressly, and I form the same
conclusion from a passage of <span class="locked">Plautus<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span>. Philematium having
taken up a mirror, the prudent Scapha gives her a towel, and
desires her to wipe her fingers, lest her lover should suspect
by the smell that she had been receiving money. Fine silver
however communicates as little smell to the fingers as gold;
but it is to be remembered that the ancients understood much
better than the moderns how to discover the fineness of the
noble metals by the smell, as many modes of proof which we
use to find out the alloy, were to them unknown. Money-changers
therefore employed their smell when they were desirous
of trying the purity of <span class="locked">coin<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span>. The witty thought of
Vespasian, who, when reproached on account of his tax upon
urine, desired those who did so to smell the money it produced,
and to tell him whether it had any smell of the article
which was the object of it, alludes to this circumstance. In
the like manner many savage nations at present can by their
smell determine the purity of <span class="locked">gold<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span>.</p>

<p>We are informed by Pliny, that Praxiteles, in the time of
Pompey the Great, made the first silver mirror, and that mirrors
of that metal were preferred to all others. Silver mirrors
however were known long before that period, as is proved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the passage of Plautus above-quoted. To reconcile this contradiction,
Meursius remarks that Pliny speaks only of his
countrymen, and not of the Greeks, who had such articles
much earlier, and the scene in Plautus is at Athens. This
therefore seems to justify the account of Pliny, but of what
he says afterwards I can find no explanation. Hardouin is of
opinion, that mirrors, according to the newest invention, at
that period, were covered behind with a plate of gold, as our
mirrors are with an amalgam. But as the ancient plates of
silver were not transparent, how could the gold at the back
part of them produce any effect in regard to the image? May
not the meaning be, that a thin plate of gold was placed at
some distance before the mirror in order to throw more light
upon its surface? But whatever may have been the case,
Pliny himself seems not to have had much confidence in the
invention.</p>

<p>Mirrors of copper, brass and gold, I have found mentioned
only by the poets, who perhaps employed the names of these
metals because they best suited their measure, or because
they wished to use uncommon expressions, and thought a
golden mirror the noblest. By the brass ones perhaps are to
be understood only such as were made of mixed copper. Did
golden mirrors occur oftener, I should be inclined to refer the
epithet rather to the frame or ornaments than to the mirror
itself; for at present we say a gold watch, though the cases
only may be of that metal.</p>

<p>Mirrors seem for a long time to have been made of a mixture
of copper and tin, as is expressly said by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span>, who
adds, that the best were constructed at Brundisium. This
mixture, which was known to Aristotle, produces a white
metal, which, on account of its colour, may have been extremely
proper for the purpose, and even at present the same
mixture, according to the careful experiments made by Mr.
Mudge, an <span class="locked">Englishman<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span>, produces the best metal for specula.
It appears that the ancients had not determined the proportion
very accurately; for Pliny assures us twice that in his
time mirrors of silver were preferred. It is indeed not easy
to ascertain the quantity of each metal that ought to be
taken, and the most advantageous degree of heat; upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
which a great deal depends. One of the principal difficulties
is to cast the metal without blisters or air-holes, and without
causing any part of the tin to oxidize, which occasions knots
and cracks, and prevents it from receiving a fine polish. A
passage of <span class="locked">Lucian<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span>, which no one as yet has been able to clear
up, alludes certainly, in my opinion, to these faults. A mixture
of copper and tin is so brittle, that it is very liable to
crack; and a mirror formed of it, if not preserved with great
care, soon becomes so dim, that it cannot be used till it has
been previously cleaned and polished. For this reason a
sponge with pounded pumice-stone was generally suspended,
from the ancient mirrors, and they were kept likewise in a
case or box, as may be seen by the greater part of those still
extant. Mirrors of silver were less subject to this inconvenience,
and I am inclined to think that the latter on this
account made the former be disused, as we are informed by
Pliny.</p>

<p>As ancient mirrors of metal are still to be found in collections
of antiquities, it might be of some importance to the
arts if chemical experiments were made on their composition.
Those who have hitherto given us any account of them
have contented themselves with describing their external
figure and shape. Count <span class="locked">Caylus<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span> is the only person, as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
as I know, who caused any chemical experiments to be undertaken
on this subject. They were made on a mirror found
near Naples, by M. Roux, who asserts that the composition
was a mixture of copper and regulus of antimony, with a little
lead. Antimony however was not known to the ancients.
If that metal was really a component part, the mirror must
have been the work of more modern times, or it must be
allowed that the artist had metal combined with antimony
without knowing it; but the latter is not probable. The
experiments made by Roux do not seem to me to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
proved in a satisfactory manner the presence of regulus of
antimony; moreover, no certain information can be derived
from them, for the antiquity of the mirror was not ascertained;
nor was it known whether it ought to be reckoned
amongst the best or the worst of the period when it was
made.</p>

<p>Those mirrors, which were so large that one could see
one’s self in them at full length, must, in all probability, have
consisted of polished plates of silver; for to cast plates of
such a size of copper and tin would have required more art
than we can allow to those periods; and I do not know whether
our artists even now would succeed in <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span>.</p>

<p>We read in various authors, that, besides metals, the ancients
formed stones into mirrors, which were likewise in use. It is
undoubtedly certain that many stones, particularly of the vitreous
kind, which are opake and of a dark colour, would
answer exceedingly well for that purpose; but let the choice
have been ever so good, they would not, in this respect, have
been nearly equal to metals. These of all mineral bodies
have the most perfect opacity; and for that reason the greatest
lustre: both these properties are produced by their solidity;
and hence they reflect more perfectly, and with more
regularity, the rays of light that proceed from other bodies.
Our glass mirrors, indeed, are properly metallic. Stones, on
the other hand, have at any rate some, though often hardly
perceptible, transparency; so that many of the rays of light
are absorbed, or at least not reflected. Mention of stone
mirrors occurs also so seldom in the ancients, that we may
conclude they were made rather for ornament than real utility.
In general, we find accounts only of polished plates or panels
of stone, fixed in the walls of wainscoted apartments,
which were celebrated on account of their property of reflection.</p>

<p>Pliny<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> praises in this respect the obsidian stone, or, as it is
now called, the Icelandic agate. Everything that he says of
it will be perfectly intelligible to those who are acquainted
with this species of stone or vitrified lava. The image reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
from a box made of it, which I have in my possession,
is like a shadow or silhouette; but with this difference, that
one sees not only the contour, but also the whole figure distinctly,
though the colours are darkened. To form it into
images and utensils, which Pliny speaks of, must have been
exceedingly difficult, on account of its brittleness. I saw at
Copenhagen, among other things made of it, a drinking-cup
and cover, on which the artist had been employed four years.</p>

<p>Domitian, when he suspected that plots were formed against
him, caused a gallery, in which he used to walk, to be lined
with <i>phengites</i>, which by its reflection showed everything
that was done behind his <span class="locked">back<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span>. Under that appellation we
are undoubtedly to understand a calcareous or gypseous spar,
or selenite, which is indeed capable of reflecting an image;
but we cannot therefore pretend to say that the ancients
formed mirrors of it; nor do I explain what Pliny says, where
he speaks of the <i>phengites</i>, as if whole buildings had been
once constructed of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span>. That kind of stone, for various reasons,
and particularly on account of its brittleness, is altogether
unfit for such a purpose. At those periods, the windows
of houses were open, and not filled up with any transparent
substance, but only covered, sometimes by lattices or curtains.
It is probable, therefore, that those openings of the
walls of the building mentioned by Pliny, where the windows
used to be, were filled up with <i>phengites</i>, which, by admitting
a faint light, prevented the place from being dark even
when the doors were shut; so that Pliny might say, “It appeared
as if the light did not fall into the building, but as if
it were inclosed in it.”</p>

<p>I might be accused of omission did I not here mention also
a passage of <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span>, where he seems to speak of a mirror
made of an emerald, which Nero used to assist him to see
the combats of the gladiators. Cary asserts that Nero was
short-sighted, and that his emerald was formed like a concave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
lens. The former is expressly said by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span>, but the
latter, though by Abat considered not <span class="locked">improbable<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span>, I can
scarcely allow myself to believe, because such an interpretation
of Pliny’s words is too forced, and because they can be
explained much better in another manner. As no mention
of such an excellent help to short-sighted people is to be
found in any other ancient author, we must allow, if Cary’s
opinion be adopted, that this property of the concave emerald
was casually remarked, and that no experiments were
made to cut any other natural or artificial glass in the same
form for the like use, because people imagined that this property
was peculiar to the emerald alone, which was then commonly
supposed to be endowed with the power of greatly
strengthening the eye-sight. Much more probable to me is
the explanation of an Italian, which Abat also does not entirely
reject, that the emerald had a smooth polished surface,
and served Nero as a <span class="locked">mirror<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span>; and the passage of Pliny
alluded to seems to have been thus understood by <span class="locked">Isidore<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span>
and Marbodæus. It may here be objected, that real emeralds
are too small to admit of being used as mirrors; but
the ancients speak of some sufficiently large for that purpose,
and also of artificial <span class="locked">ones<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span>; so that we may with certainty
conclude, that they classed among the emeralds fluor-spar
green vitrified lava, or the green Icelandic agate as it is called,
green jasper, and also green glass. The piece of green glass
in the monastery of Reichenau, which is seven inches in
length, three inches in thickness, and weighs twenty-eight
pounds three-quarters; and the large cup at Genoa, which is
however full of <span class="locked">flaws<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span>, have been given out to be emeralds
even to the present time.</p>

<p>Mirrors were made also of rubies, as we are assured by
<span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span>, who refers to Theophrastus for his authority; but
this precious stone is never found now of such a size as to
render this use possible; and Gary and the anonymous Italian
before-mentioned have proved very properly that Pliny has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
committed a gross mistake, which has not been observed by
Hardouin. Theophrastus, in the passage alluded <span class="locked">to<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span>, does
not speak of a ruby, but of the well-known black marble of
Chio, though he calls both <i>carbunculus</i>, a name given to the
ruby on account of its likeness to a burning coal, and to the
black marble on account of its likeness to a quenched coal
or cinder; and the latter, as well as the obsidian stone, was
used sometimes for mirrors.</p>

<p>The account how mirrors were formed by the native Americans,
before they had the misfortune to become acquainted
with the Europeans, is of considerable importance in the
history of this art. These people had indeed mirrors which
the Europeans could not help admiring. Some of them were
made of black, somewhat transparent, vitrified lava, called by
the Spaniards <i>gallinazo</i>, and which is of the same kind as the
obsidian stone employed by the Romans for the like purpose.
Of this substance the Americans had plane, concave, and
convex mirrors. They had others also made of a mineral
called the Inca’s <span class="locked">stone<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span>, which, as has been already said by
Bomare, Sage, Wallerius, and other mineralogists, was a compact
pyrites or marcasite, susceptible of a fine polish; and on
that account often brought to Europe, and worn formerly in
rings under the name of the stone of health. Ulloa says the
Inca’s stone is brittle, opake, and of a somewhat bluish colour;
it has often veins which cannot be polished, and where
these veins are it frequently breaks. The mirrors formed of
it, which he saw, were from two to three inches in diameter;
but he saw one which was a foot and a half. The opinion
which some have entertained, that these mirrors were cast,
has no other foundation than the likeness of polished marcasite
to cast brass. This mineral is very proper for reflecting
images; and I am inclined to think that the Peruvians had
better mirrors than the Greeks or the Romans, among whom
we find no traces of marcasite being employed in that manner.
It appears, however, that the Indians had mirrors also
of silver, copper, and <span class="locked">brass<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span>.</p>

<p>I come now to the question in what century were invented
our glass mirrors, which consist of a glass plate covered at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
the back with a thin leaf of metal. This question has been
answered by some with so much confidence, that one might
almost consider the point to be determined; but instead of
real proofs, we find only conjectures or probabilities; and I
must here remark, that I cannot help thinking that they are
older than has hitherto been supposed, however desirous I
may be to separate historical truth from conjecture. When I
have brought together everything which I know on the subject,
I would say, that attempts were even made at Sidon to
form mirrors of glass; but that they must have been inferior
to those of metal, because they did not banish the use of the
latter. The first glass mirrors appear to me to have been
of black-coloured glass, or an imitation of the obsidian stone;
and to have been formed afterwards of a glass plate with some
black foil placed behind <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span>. At a much later period, blown
glass, while hot, was covered in the inside with lead or some
metallic mixture; and still later, and, as appears, first at Murano,
artists began to cover plates of glass with an amalgam
of tin and quicksilver. The newest improvements are, the
casting of glass-plates, and the art of making plates equally
large by blowing and stretching, without the expensive and
uncertain process which is required for casting.</p>

<p>That glass mirrors were made at the celebrated glass-houses
of Sidon, is mentioned so clearly by Pliny that it cannot
be <span class="locked">doubted<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span>. When I read the passage, however, without
prejudice, without taking into consideration what others
have said on it, and compare it with what certain information
the ancients, in my opinion, give on the same subject, I can
understand it no otherwise than as if the author said, that the
art of manufacturing glass various ways was invented, principally,
at Sidon, where attempts had been made to form
mirrors of it. He appears therefore to allude to experiments
which had not completely succeeded; and to say that such
attempts, at the time when he wrote, had been entirely abandoned
and were almost forgotten. Had this circumstance
formed an epoch in the art, Pliny, in another place, where he
describes the various improvements of it so fully, would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
have omitted it; but of those experiments he makes no further
<span class="locked">mention<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span>. All the inventions which he speaks of, evidently
relate to metal mirrors only, of which the silver, at
that time, were the newest. Had the Sidonian mirrors consisted
of glass plates covered at the back, those of metal, the
making of which was, at any rate, attended with no less trouble,
which were more inconvenient for use on account of their
aptness to break, their requiring to be frequently cleaned and
preserved in a case, and which were more unpleasant on account
of the faint, dull image which they reflected, could not
possibly have continued so long in use as they really did; and
circumstances and expressions relative to glass mirrors must
certainly have occurred. Though glass continued long to be
held in high estimation, particularly at Rome; and though
many kinds of glass-ware are mentioned in ancient authors,
among costly pieces of furniture, mirrors are mentioned only
among articles of silver plate. I am acquainted with no certain
trace of glass mirrors from the time of Pliny to the thirteenth
century; but after that period, at which they are spoken
of in the clearest manner, we find them often mentioned in
every century; and mirrors of metal at length entirely disappear.</p>

<p>How the Sidonian mirrors were made, is not known; but
if I may be allowed a conjecture, I am of opinion that they
consisted of dark-coloured glass, which had a resemblance to
the obsidian stone. Such is the usual progress of inventions.
At those periods one had no other representation of glass
mirrors than that afforded by natural glass or vitreous stones.
When artists wished to make mirrors of glass, they would try
to imitate the latter. After the invention of printing, people
endeavoured to render printed books as like as possible to
manuscripts; because they imagined that this invention was
to be approved only so far as it enabled them to imitate these,
without observing that it could far excel the art of writing.
But the Sidonian glass mirrors were so much surpassed by
the silver or brass ones, which perhaps were invented about
the same time, that on this account they were never brought
into use. Glass mirrors, perhaps, would have been invented
sooner, had mankind employed at an earlier period glass-windows,
which often, when they are shut on the outside so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
that no light can pass through them, reflect images in a much
better manner than the best mirrors of metal. This observation,
which may be made daily, would then, in all probability,
have been sooner turned to advantage.</p>

<p>No one has employed a greater profusion of words to maintain
an opinion opposite to mine, than Abat; but when his
proofs are divested of their ornaments, they appear so weak
that one has very little inclination to agree with him. “The
observation,” says he, “that a plate of glass is the best mirror,
when all other rays of light, except those reflected back from
the glass, are prevented, by a metallic covering placed behind
it, from falling on the eye, is so easy, that it must have been
made immediately after the invention of glass.” Who does
not think here of Columbus and his egg? Instances occur
in history of many having approached so near an invention,
that we are astonished how they could have missed it; so
that we may exclaim with a certain emperor, “Taurum toties
non ferire difficile <span class="locked">est<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span>.” “The Sidonian invention,” continues
he, “would not have been worth mentioning, had it not produced
better mirrors than those which the ancients had before
of the obsidian stone. But these even are mentioned
only once, in so short and abrupt a manner, and as it were
out of ridicule, that one may easily perceive they were not
much esteemed.” “If the Sidonians,” adds he, “were not
the inventors, let some other inventor be mentioned;” and
he assures us that he had sought information on this subject,
in Neri, Kunkel, and Merret, but without success. That I
believe; but Abat does not remark that by the same manner
of reasoning we may ascribe to the Sidonians the invention
of watches, and many other articles, the inventors of which
are not to be found in books where they ought as much to be
expected as the inventor of glass in Neri. The grounds on
which many old commentators of the Bible, Nicholas de Lyra
and others, have supposed that glass mirrors were known so
early as the time of Moses, are still weaker. If quoting the
names of writers who entertain a like opinion be of any weight,
I could produce a much greater number of learned men, who,
after an express examination of the question, deny altogether
that glass mirrors were used by the ancients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Dr. <span class="locked">Watson<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> also has endeavoured to support the opinion
of Abat, but with less confidence and with more critical acumen.
His grounds, I think, I have weakened already; but
one observation here deserves not to be overlooked, because
it suggests an idea that may serve to illustrate a passage of
Pliny, which, as I before remarked, has never yet been explained.
“If we admit,” says he, “that Pliny was acquainted
with glass mirrors, we may thus understand what he says respecting
an invention, which was then new, of applying gold
behind a mirror.” Instead of an amalgam of tin, some one
had proposed to cover the back of the mirror with an amalgam
of gold, with which the ancients were certainly acquainted,
and which they employed in <span class="locked">gilding<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span>. He mentions,
also, on this occasion, that a thought had once occurred
to Buffon, that an amalgam of gold might be much better
for mirrors than that used at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span>. This conjecture appears,
at any rate, to be ingenious; but when I read the passage
again, without prejudice, I can hardly believe that Pliny
alludes to a plate of glass in a place where he speaks only of
metallic mirrors; and the overlaying with amalgam requires
too much art to allow me to ascribe it to such a period without
sufficient proof. I consider it more probable that some
person had tried, by means of a polished plate of gold, to collect
the rays of light, and to throw them either on the mirror
or the object, in order to render the image brighter.</p>

<p>Professor Heeren showed me a passage in the Ecloga of
Stobæus, which, on the first view, seems to allude to a glass
<span class="locked">mirror<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span>. It is there said, Philolaus the Pythagorean believed
that the sun was a vitreous body, which only received the
rays of the æthereal fire and reflected them to us like a
mirror. When we compare, however, the words of Stobæus
with those by which <span class="locked">Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span>, Achilles <span class="locked">Tatius<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span>, <span class="locked">Eusebius<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span>,
and others, express the same thing, that meaning cannot be
drawn from them. It appears, at first, as if Philolaus had
considered the sun to be transparent, and supposed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
rays passed through it, and came condensed to our earth, in
the same manner as they are brought to a focus by a glass
globe. Some commentators have explained the passage in
this manner; and on account of the affinity of the Greek
words have thought also of a funnel. In that case, however,
the comparison of the sun with a mirror would not have been
just; and if it be admitted that Philolaus considered the sun
as a bright body endowed with the property of reflection,
what he says of rays passing or transmitted through it, and
of the pores of the sun’s body, will become unintelligible.
But even if we adopt the last explanation, that Philolaus
imagined the sun to be a mirror, it does not follow that he
had any idea of a glass <span class="locked">one<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span>; and besides, he only speaks
of a body capable of reflecting a strong light; and that glass,
under certain circumstances, is fit for that purpose, may have
been remarked as soon as it was invented, though men might
not find out the art of forming it into proper mirrors by
placing some opake substance behind <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span>. Empedocles also
said, that the sun was a mirror, and that the light received by
our earth was the reflection of the æthereal fire, which Eusebius
compares to the reflection made by <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
In the problems ascribed to Alexander of Aphrodisias,
glass mirrors, covered on the back with tin, are clearly mentioned;
but this information does not lead us one step further
in the history of the art; as it is proved that the above
Alexander, who lived in the beginning of the third century,
could not have written that work. The author, who must
have been a physician, maintains the immortality of the soul,
which Alexander of Aphrodisias, with Aristotle, denies.
Some therefore have ascribed these problems to Alexander
Trallianus, who practised physic in the middle of the sixth
century; but this is only a conjecture which no one has as
yet rendered probable, especially as there have been many
physicians of the name of Alexander. The problem to which
I allude is not to be found in every manuscript and edition;
so that it is doubtful whether it may not be the production
of a later author than that of the rest of the book, particularly
as it is certain that many who had it in their possession
added problems of various kinds according to their pleasure.
However this may be, it is evident that the author of this
problem was acquainted with mirrors covered at the back;
and the expression which he uses does not merely imply that
a leaf of tin was placed behind the glass plate, but that the
tin in a liquid state was rubbed over it. The old French
translator thinks that the author speaks of windows; but that
opinion is undoubtedly <span class="locked">false<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>.</p>

<p>Of as little importance as the above passage of Alexander,
is another of Isidore, often quoted in support of the antiquity
of glass mirrors. On the first view it appears to be a testimony
of great weight; but when closely examined it becomes
reduced to very little. “Nothing,” says he, “is so fit for
mirrors as <span class="locked">glass<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span>.” Abat and others, who have considered
these words as decisive, make less hesitation to ascribe to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
sixth century, in which Isidore lived, a knowledge of mirrors
covered on the back with tin and quicksilver, as the same
writer, in another place, observes, that quicksilver can be
kept in no vessel but one of <span class="locked">glass<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span>. It is very true that a
glass filled with that metal will form a very good mirror;
but I am of opinion that this may have been long known,
before people thought of making an amalgam of tin and
quicksilver in order to cover the backs of mirrors. The
first passage, which is properly the one of any consequence,
loses its force when we see that it is taken from Pliny and
copied incorrectly. The latter says, that one can give to
glass every kind of shape and colour, and that no substance
is more ductile, or fitter to be moulded into any <span class="locked">form<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span>.
Isidore, as is usual, says the same thing, and in the same
words, except, that instead of <i>sequacior</i> he substitutes <i>speculis
aptior</i>; so that the mention of a mirror is altogether unexpected,
and so little suited to what goes before and what
follows, that one must believe that this alteration, occasioned
perhaps by the similitude of the words, or by an abbreviation,
was not made by Isidore, but by some transcriber. But
even if we believe that Isidore himself spoke of glass being
used at that period for mirrors, we are not able to comprehend,
from what he says, how glass mirrors were made in the
sixth century.</p>

<p>I have met with no information respecting this subject in
the whole period between the age of Isidore and the eleventh
century. About the year 1100, at least as is supposed not
without probability, Alhazen the Arabian wrote his well-known
treatise on Optics, in which I conjectured that I
should find mention made of glass mirrors; but I searched
that work in vain, though I must confess I did not read it
through entirely. Where he begins his catoptrical lessons,
he however often speaks of iron mirrors, by which we may
understand mirrors of the best steel. In explaining a certain
phænomenon, he says, that the cause of it cannot be in the
darkness of the iron mirror, because if a mirror of silver be
used, the same effects will be produced. Would he not on
this occasion have introduced glass mirrors, had he been as
well-acquainted with them as with those already mentioned?
At first, he never speaks of mirrors without adding of iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
of silver; but he mentions them afterwards without any epithet
of the kind.</p>

<p>All these mirrors I find also in the Optics of Vitello, who
wrote in the middle of the thirteenth century, in Italy, a
country which was at that time almost the only one where
the arts <span class="locked">flourished<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span>. That author has, indeed, borrowed a
great deal from Alhazen, though there are many things of
his own, and he gives an account of some experiments on
the refracting power of glass; but he never, as far as I have
observed, mentions glass mirrors. Whether Jordanus Nemorarius,
or Nemoratius, who also wrote, in the thirteenth century,
a book <i>De Speculorum Natura</i>, makes mention of them,
I do not know, because I have never had an opportunity of
seeing that work. I am of opinion it was never printed.</p>

<p>It is in the thirteenth century, that I find the first undoubted
mention of glass mirrors covered at the back with tin
or lead. Johannes Peckham, or Peccam, an English
Franciscan monk, who taught at Oxford, Paris, and Rome,
and who died in 1292, wrote about the year 1279 a treatise
of optics, which was once printed, with the title of Johannis
Pisani Perspectiva <span class="locked">Communis<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span>. In this work, besides mirrors
made of iron, steel, and polished marble, the author not
only speaks often of glass mirrors, but says also that they were
covered on the back with lead, and that no image was reflected
when the lead was scraped off. Vincentius <span class="locked">Bellovacensis<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span>
speaks in a manner still clearer, for he tells us that lead was
poured over the glass plate while hot. To the same century

That this invention cannot be much older we have reason
to conclude, because glass mirrors were extremely scarce in
France even in the fourteenth century, while mirrors of metal
were in common use; and we are told that the mirror of Anne
de Bretagne, consort of Louis XII., was of the latter <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span>.
Metal mirrors also were made and employed in Persia and
the East, where indeed ancient usages continued longest, and
glass mirrors were not known there till the commencement of
the European trade with these remote regions. The former
are still preferred in those countries, because they are not so
liable to break, and can be preserved better in a dry hot
climate than the amalgam of the latter.</p>

<p>Respecting the progress of this art, I know nothing more
than what follows:&mdash;At first, melted lead, or perhaps tin, was
poured over the glass plate while yet hot as it came from the
furnace. This process agrees with that which, since very
early periods, has been employed in or around Nuremberg
for making convex mirrors by blowing with the pipe into the
glass-bubble whilst still hot a metallic mixture, with a little
resin or salt of tartar, which prevents oxidation and assists the
fusion. When the bubble is covered all over in the inside,
and after it has cooled, it is cut into small round mirrors.
This art is an old German invention, for it is described by
Porta and Garzoni, who both lived in the beginning of the
sixteenth century, and who both expressly say, that it was
then common in Germany. Curious foreigners often attempted
to learn it, and imagined that the Germans kept it a
secret. Boyle made various experiments in order to discover
the process; and the secretary of the Royal Society endeavoured,
by means of the ambassador from Charles II., who,
perhaps about 1670, resided at Frankfort, to obtain a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
of it; but did not succeed, as we are told by <span class="locked">Leibnitz<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span>.
It was called the art of preparing mirrors without foil; and
it was highly esteemed, because it was supposed that it might
be useful to those fond of catoptrics, by enabling them to
form convex and concave mirrors themselves. This account
of Leibnitz seems to have led Von Murr into a slight error,
and induced him to believe that the art of making convex
mirrors without foil was first found out at Nuremberg in 1670.
I introduce this remark because I flatter myself he will not
be displeased that I make the above service, rendered by his
native city, to be a century and a half older. These small
convex mirrors, which reflect a diminished, but a clearer
image than our usual mirrors, are perhaps made still, though
they are not now carried round so frequently for sale in Germany
as they were thirty years ago, at which time, if I remember
right, they were called (<i>Ochsen-augen</i>) ox-eyes.
They were set in a round painted board, and had a very
broad border or margin. One of them, in my possession, is
two inches and a half in diameter. It is probable that the
low price of plane mirrors, when glass-houses began to be
more numerous, occasioned these convex ones to be little
sought after. The mixture employed in making them was,
according to Porta, antimony, lead, and colophonium; but
according to Garzoni, it was <i>una mistura di piombo, stagno,
marchesita d’argento, e tartaro</i>, which in the German edition
is translated very badly, “lead, tin, flint, silver, and tartar.”
The following observation perhaps is not altogether useless:
Colophonium, which is employed on many other occasions
for soldering, was formerly called mirror-resin, and was sold
under that name even in the beginning of the present century.
Frisch assigns no reason for this appellation, and Jacobson
gives a wrong one, viz. its having a bright shining surface
when broken. The true reason was the above-mentioned
use; and as that is now very little known, it is called from
that to which it is principally applied, violin-resin.</p>

<p>It appears that, instead of pouring melted metal over plates
of glass, artists for some time applied to them the before-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>mentioned
amalgam of tin, or covered them in some other manner,
perhaps in the same way as Boyle covered concave glasses
in the inside. Porta however saw almost the same process
employed at Murano as that which is still followed at present.
The tin, hammered to thin leaves, was spread out very
smoothly; and quicksilver was poured over it, and rubbed
into it, either with the hand or a hare’s foot; and when the
tin was saturated it was covered with paper. The glass,
wiped exceedingly clean, was then laid above it; and while
the workman pressed it down with his left hand, he drew
out very carefully with his right the paper that lay between
the tin and the glass, over which weights were afterwards
placed. This much at any rate is certain, that the method
of covering with tin foil was known at Murano so early as
the sixteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span>, and therefore it is much older than
J. M. Hoffmann supposes. To conclude, whether this ingenious
invention belongs to the Venetians, as several later,
and particularly Italian, writers assert, I can neither prove
nor contradict; but it is well known that till about the end
of the seventeenth century their mirrors were sold all over
Europe and in both the Indies. After that period the glass-houses
in other countries were improved, and new ones
established; and the discovery made in France, that glass,
like metal, could be cast into much larger plates than had
been before prepared by blowing and rolling, was in more
than one respect prejudicial to the sale of those made at
Venice.</p>

<p>So early as the year 1634, attempts were made in France
to establish glass-houses for manufacturing mirrors, and
Eustache Grandmont obtained a patent for that purpose;
but his undertaking was not attended with success. As
Colbert exerted himself very much to promote manufactures
of every kind, Nicholas de Noyer proposed to make mirrors
according to the Venetian method. This plan was adopted
by Charles Rivière, sieur du Freni, valet-de-chambre to the
king; and having procured the royal permission, he sold it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
afterwards for a large sum to De Noyer, who, in 1665, received
a confirmation of the patent, and an advance of
12,000 livres for four years, on condition of his procuring
workmen from Venice, who, after serving eight years in the
kingdom, were to be naturalized. De Noyer was joined by
several more, who entered into partnership with him, and
particularly by one Poquelin, who had hitherto carried on
the greatest trade in Venetian mirrors, and who engaged
workmen from Murano. The glass-houses were erected at
the village of Tourlaville, near Cherbourg, in Lower Normandy.
After the death of Colbert, who was succeeded by
Louvois, the charter of the company was in 1684 renewed
for thirty years longer, and at that period Pierre de Bagneux
was at the head of it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had five years of this period elapsed, when, in
1688, Abraham Thevart made a proposal to the court for
casting glass mirrors of a much larger size than any ever before
made. This plan, after an accurate investigation, was
approved; and in the same year he received the royal permission
to use his invention for thirty years, but it was not
registered till 1693 or 1694. The first plates were cast at
Paris, and astonished every artist who saw them. They were
eighty-four inches in height, and fifty in breadth. In order to
lessen the excessive expense, the glass-houses were erected at
St. Gobin, in Picardy; and to prevent all dispute with the old
privileged company, Thevart was expressly bound to make
plates at least sixty inches in length and forty in breadth,
whereas the largest of those made before had never exceeded
forty-five or fifty inches in length. On the other hand, the
old company were allowed to make plates of a smaller size,
and were prohibited from employing any of the instruments
or apparatus invented by Thevart. These however had not
been so accurately defined as to remove all cause of litigation
between the companies, and for that reason permission
was at length granted, in 1695, for both to be united into
one, under the inspection of François Plastrier, to whom the
king, in 1699, sold the palace of St. Gobin. After this they
declined so rapidly, that in 1701 they were not able to pay
their debts, and were obliged to abandon several of the furnaces.
To add to their misfortune, some of the workmen
whom they had discharged retired to other countries, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
were already jealous of the French invention, and wished to
turn it to their advantage. The French writers assert that
their attempts never succeeded, and that most of the workmen
returned again to France, when a new company was
formed in 1702, under the management of Antoine d’Agincourt,
who by prudent œconomy improved the establishment,
so as to render the profit very considerable. At present
mirrors are cast as well as blown, both at St. Gobin and at
Cherbourg; and in 1758 the price of them was greatly reduced,
in order probably to weaken the competition of the
foreign glass-houses, among which there are many not inferior
to the French.</p>

<p>This short history of the glass manufactories in France is
collected from <span class="locked">Savary<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span> and <span class="locked">Expilly<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span>. A more particular
account perhaps may be expected of the inventor, of his first
experiments, and of their success; but notwithstanding a
strict search, I have not been able to find any further information
on the subject. We are told only that his name was sieur
Abraham Thevart, though the historians who record that circumstance
have filled their pages with uninteresting anecdotes,
and even with the vices of many of the courtiers of the
same period.</p>

<p>The principal benefit which has arisen to the art from this
invention, properly is, that much larger mirrors can be obtained
than formerly; for when attempts were made to blow
very large plates, they were always too thin. Casting, however,
besides great expense in <span class="locked">apparatus<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span>, requires so many
expert workmen, and so tedious and severe labour, and is
accompanied with so much danger, that it is only seldom that
plates of an extraordinary size succeed, and the greater part
of them must be cut into smaller plates which might have
been blown. Those cast are never so even and smooth as
those that have been blown; they require therefore a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
deal of polishing, and on that account must be very thick.
The monstrous mass requisite for a mirror of the largest size,
stands ready melted in a very frail red-hot earthen pot, which
is taken from the furnace and placed upon an iron plate,
strongly heated, that the mass may be cast upon it into a
glass plate. The latter must then be speedily conveyed to
the cooling-furnace, and if it be found free from faults, it is
ground, polished and silvered; but the last part of the process
is generally done at the place where a purchaser can be
found for so expensive an article, in order that less loss may
be sustained in case it should happen to break by the way.</p>

<p>These great difficulties, which have excited the astonishment
of every one who has seen the process, and that of finding
sale for so expensive and magnificent wares, have obliged
artists to return to the old method of blowing; and many
have been so fortunate in improving this branch of manufacture,
that plates are formed now by blowing, sixty-four
Flemish inches in height and twenty-three in breadth, which
it was impossible to make before but by casting.</p>

<p>The mass of matter necessary for this purpose, weighing
more than a hundred pounds, is by the workman blown into
the shape of a large bag; it is then reduced to the form of a
cylinder, and being cut up, is, by stretching, rolling it with a
smooth iron, and other means, transformed into an even plane.</p>

<p>[All but the very commonest mirrors are now made of
plate-glass; which is also used to a great extent for window-panes,
and is manufactured by casting, rolling and
polishing. The enormous plates of glass which are seen in
many of the large shops of this city are well-calculated to
excite the astonishment of those who are not yet aware of the
late improvements in this branch of manufacture. An idea
of what may be accomplished by blowing was given in 1845,
at the Exhibition at Vienna, where a blown glass 7 feet in
length and 3½ in breadth was exhibited; and which was of
sufficient thickness to admit of polishing. Nevertheless, the
casting of plate-glass is now managed with such comparative
ease, that there appears to be no limit to the size to which the
plates can be brought, so that the blowing of large panes of
glass is given up in this country. Private houses may now be
seen decorated with single sheets of glass upwards of 20 feet
in height and 10 in width.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
A patent for a very ingenious process for silvering glass
was taken out in November 1843 by Mr. Drayton. It consists
in depositing silver, from a solution, upon glass, by
deoxidizing the oxide of silver in solution, so that the precipitate
will adhere to the glass, without the latter having
been coated with metallic or other substances. This is
effected by mixing 1 oz. of coarsely powdered nitrate of
silver with ½ oz. of spirits of hartshorn and 2 oz. of water;
after standing for 24 hours, the mixture is filtered (the deposit
on the filter, which contains silver, being preserved),
and an addition is made thereto of 3 oz. of spirit (by preference,
spirit of wine) at 60° above proof, or naphtha;
from 20 to 30 drops of oil of cassia are then added, and after
remaining for about 6 hours longer, the solution is ready for
use. The glass to be silvered must have a clean and polished
surface; it is to be placed in a horizontal position, and a wall
of putty formed around it, so that the solution may cover the
surface of the glass to the depth of from ⅛th to ¼th of an
inch. After the solution has been poured on the glass, from 6
to 12 drops of a mixture of oil of cloves and spirit of wine (in
the proportion of 1 part by measure of the oil to 3 of spirit of
wine) are dropped into it at different places; or the diluted
oil of cloves may be mixed with the solution before it is poured
upon the glass; the more oil of cloves used, the more rapid
will be the deposition of the silver, but the patentee prefers
that it should occupy about two hours. When the required
deposit has been obtained, the solution is poured off;
and as soon as the silver on the glass is perfectly dry, it is
varnished with a composition, formed by melting together
equal quantities of bees’ wax and tallow. The patentee states
that, by experiment, he has ascertained that about 18 grs. of
nitrate of silver are used for each square foot of glass.</p>

<p>It has been urged as an objection to this process, that in the
course of a few weeks the surfaces of the mirrors formed by
it become dotted over with small brownish-red spots, which
greatly injures their appearance. Dr. Stenhouse states that
these spots are caused by the metallic silver, whilst being deposited
on the surface of the glass, carrying down with it mechanically
small quantities of a resinous matter, resulting
most probably from the oxidation of the oil. This subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
acts upon the metallic surface with which it is in
contact, and produces the small brown spots already mentioned.
Mr. Drayton, however, states that the brown spots
only occur when the oil employed is old and unfit for use.]</p>

p. 330. Having requested Professor Tychsen’s opinion on this subject, I
received the following answer:&mdash;“You have conjectured very properly that
the mirrors of the Israelitish women, mentioned Exod. xxxviii. 8, were
not employed for ornamenting or covering the washing-basins, in order
that the priests might behold themselves in them; but that they were
melted and basins cast of them. The former was a conceit first advanced,
if I am not mistaken, by Nicol. de Lyra, in the fourteenth century, and
which Michaelis himself adopted in the year 1754; but he afterwards retracted
his opinion when he made his translation of the Old Testament at
a riper age. In the Hebrew expression there is no ground for it; and
mirrors could hardly be placed very conveniently in a basin employed for
washing the feet. I must at the same time confess that the word
(<span xml:lang="he" lang="he">מראת</span>) which is here supposed to signify a mirror, occurs nowhere else
in that sense. Another explanation therefore has been given, by which
both the women and mirrors disappear from the passage. It is by a
learned Fleming, Hermann Gid. Clement, and may be found in his Dissertatio
de Labro Æneo, Groning. 1732, and also in Ugolini Thesaurus,
tom. xix. p. 1505. He translates the passage thus: Fecit labrum æneum
et operculum ejus æneum cum <i>figuris ornantibus</i>, quæ ornabant ostium
tabernaculi. This explanation however is attended with very great difficulties;
and as all the old translators and Jewish commentators have
here understood mirrors; and as the common translation is perfectly
agreeable to the language and circumstances, we ought to believe that
Moses, not having copper, melted down the mirrors of his countrywomen
and converted them into washing-basins for the priests.”</p></div>

Salmasius chooses rather to read <i>specellatam</i>. I am inclined to
think that this word ought to be read in Suetonius instead of <i>speculatum</i>,
where he speaks of an apartment which Horace seems to have been fond of.
That historian, in his Life of Horace, says, “Ad res venereas intemperantior
traditur: nam <i>speculato</i> cubiculo scorta dicitur habuisse disposita, ut quocunque
respexisset, ibi ei imago coitus referretur.” Lessing, who in his Miscellanies
(Vermischten Schriften, Berlin 1784, 12mo, iii. p. 205) endeavours
to vindicate the poet from this aspersion, considers the expression <i>speculatum
cubiculum</i>, if translated <i>an apartment lined with mirrors</i>, as contrary
to the Latin idiom, and thinks therefore that the whole passage is a
forgery. Baxter also before said that this anecdote had been inserted by
some malicious impostor. This I will not venture to contradict, but I am
of opinion that <i>specillatum</i> or <i>specellatum cubiculum</i> is at any rate as
much agreeable to the Roman idiom as <i>patina specillata</i>. This expression
Salmasius and Casaubon have justified by similar phrases, such as
<i>opera filicata</i>, <i>tesselata</i>, <i>hederata</i>, &amp;c. The chamber in which Claudian
makes Venus ornament herself, and be overcome by the persuasion of
Cupid, was also covered over with mirrors, so that whichever way her
eyes turned, she could see her own image. Did Claudian imagine that
this goddess knew how to employ such an apartment, not only for dressing,
but even after she was undressed, as well as Horace? I have seen at
a certain court, a bed entirely covered in the inside with mirrors.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_156" id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> As the account of these experiments is given only in an expensive
work, which may not often fall into the hands of those who are best able
to examine it, I insert it here. “The ancient mirror, which I examined,
was a metallic mixture, very tender and brittle, and of a whitish colour
inclining to grey. When put into the fire, it remained a long time in a
state of ignition before it melted. It was neither inflammable nor emitted
any smell like garlic, which would have been the case had it contained
arsenic. It did not either produce those flowers which are generally produced
by all mixtures in which there is zinc. Besides, the basis of this
mixture being copper, it would have been of a yellow colour had that
semi-metal formed a part of it. I took two drams of it and dissolved
them in the nitrous acid. A solution was speedily formed, which assumed
the same colour as solutions of copper. It precipitated a white powder,
which I carefully edulcorated and dried. Having put it into a
crucible with a reductive flux, I obtained lead very soft and malleable.
</p>
<p>
“Having filtered the solution, I took a part of it, upon which I poured
an infusion of gall-nuts, but it produced no change. A solution of gold,
which I poured upon another part, made it assume a beautiful green colour;
but no precipitate was formed: which is sufficient to prove that
there was neither iron nor tin in the mixture.
</p>
<p>
“On the remaining part of the solution I poured a sufficient quantity
of the volatile alkali to dissolve all the copper that might be contained in
it. The solution became of a beautiful sapphire blue colour, and a white
precipitate was formed. Having decanted the liquor, and carefully edulcorated
the precipitate, I endeavoured to reduce it; but whether it was
owing to the quantity being too small, or to my not giving it sufficient
heat, I could not succeed. I had recourse therefore to another method.
</p>
<p>
“I took the weight of two drams of the mixture, which I brought to a
high state of ignition in a cuppel. When it was of a whitish-red colour,
I threw upon it gradually four drams of sulphur, and when the flame
ceased, I strengthened the fire in order to bring it to complete fusion.
By these means I obtained a tender brittle regulus, whiter than the mixture,
in which I observed a few small needles. Being apprehensive that
some copper might still remain, I sulphurated it a second time, and then
obtained a small regulus which was almost pure antimony.
</p>
<p>
“It results from these experiments, that the metal of which the ancients
made their mirrors was a composition of copper, regulus of antimony,
and lead. Copper was the predominant, and lead the smallest
part of the mixture; but it is very difficult, as is well known, to determine
with any certainty the exact proportion of the substances contained
in such compositions.”

[In the examination of an Etruscan mirror, which was placed in my
hands for analysis by Professor Gerhardt of Berlin, it was found to consist,
in 100 parts, of 67·12 copper, 24·93 tin, and 8·13 lead, approximating
closely to an alloy of eight parts of copper to three of tin and one
of lead. The oxide of tin obtained in the course of analysis was carefully
examined, before the blowpipe, for antimony, but I did not succeed in
detecting a trace of that metal. A similar mirror had been likewise analysed
by Klaproth; he found 62 per cent. copper, 32 tin, and 6 per cent.
lead, but no trace of antimony.&mdash;W. F.]</p></div>

I shall here insert it for the satisfaction of the learned reader. The
critics, says he, will hardly be persuaded that the words <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">καὶ τὸ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ
πυροειδὲς κατὰ τὸ ἐσοπτροειδὲς</span> are correct, as they can be translated
different ways. With regard to the explanation of the matter, I build
only on the plain meaning of the words. The author tells us, that Philolaus
thought the sun to be a mirror; but we must conclude that he speaks
of a mirror such as were then in use; a smooth plate of metal, and not a
globe. In this case the first explanation of a glass globe falls to the
ground. This is confirmed by Eusebius, who calls it <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ὑαλοειδὴς δίσκος</span>,
though it is possible that the latter word may be a gloss added by some
grammarian, or by Eusebius himself. If we enter further into the explanation,
we must adopt the plain idea, that the rays of the sun fall upon
this plate, and are reflected to us. I am however of opinion, that <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ὕαλος</span>
ought to be translated <i>glass</i>, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ὑαλοειδὴς</span> <i>glassy</i> or <i>vitreous</i>; for the intention
of Philolaus evidently was to define the substance of the sun’s body.
The result of the whole is, Philolaus considered the sun as a plain plate
of glass which reflected the rays or brightness of the æthereal fire. But
that he was acquainted with a proper glass mirror does not thence follow
with certainty.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="glass">GLASS-CUTTING. ETCHING ON GLASS.</h2>

<p>I do not here mean to enter into the history of engraving on
stone, as that subject has been already sufficiently illustrated
by several men of learning well acquainted with antiquities.
I shall only observe, that the ancient Greek artists formed
upon glass both raised and engraved figures; as may be seen
by articles still preserved in collections, though it is probable
that many pieces of glass may have been moulded like paste;
for that art also is of very great <span class="locked">antiquity<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span>. It appears likewise
that they cut upon plates of glass and hollow glass vessels
all kinds of figures and ornaments, in the same manner
as names, coats of arms, flowers, landscapes, &amp;c. are cut upon
drinking-glasses at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span>. If we can believe that learned
engraver in stone, the celebrated Natter, the ancients employed
the same kind of instruments for this purpose as those
used by the <span class="locked">moderns<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span>. They undoubtedly had in like manner
a wheel which moved round in a horizontal direction
above the work-table, or that machine which by writers is
called a lapidary’s wheel.</p>

<p>If this conjecture be true, what Pliny says respecting the
various ways of preparing glass is perfectly intelligible. It is
turned, says he, by the wheel, and engraven like silver. In my
opinion we are to understand by the first part of this sentence,
that the glass was cut by the wheel, like stone, both hollow
and in relief, though it is possible that drinking-cups or
vessels may have been formed from the glass metal by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
of the wheel <span class="locked">also<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span>. In the latter part of the sentence we
must not imagine that Pliny alludes to gravers like those used
by silversmiths, for the comparison will not apply to instruments
or to the manner of working, which in silver and glass
must be totally different; but to the figures delineated on the
former, which were only cut out on the surface in a shallow
manner; and such figures were formed on glass by the ancient
artists, as they are by our glass-cutters, by means of a
wheel.</p>

<p>Many, however, affirm that the art of glass-cutting, together
with the necessary instruments, was first invented in
the beginning of the seventeenth century. The inventor is said
to have been Casper Lehmann, who originally was a cutter of
steel and iron; and who made an attempt, which succeeded,
of cutting crystal, and afterwards glass, in the like manner.
He was in the service of the emperor Rodolphus II., who, in
the year 1609, besides presents, conferred on him the title of
lapidary and glass-cutter to the court, and gave him a patent
by which every one except himself was forbidden to exercise
this new art. He worked at Prague, where he had an assistant
named Zacharias Belzer; but George Schwanhard the
elder, one of his scholars, carried on the same business to a
far greater extent. The latter, who was a son of Hans
Schwanhard, a joiner at Rothenburg, was born in 1601; and
in 1618 went to Prague to learn the art of glass-cutting from
Lehmann. By his good behaviour he so much gained the
esteem of his master, who died a bachelor in 1622, that he
was left his heir; and obtained from the emperor Rodolphus a
continuation of Lehmann’s patent. Schwanhard, however, removed
to Nuremberg, where he worked for many of the principal
nobility; and by these means procured to that city the
honour of being accounted the birth-place of this new art.
In the year 1652 he worked at Prague and Ratisbon by command
of the emperor Ferdinand III., and died in 1667, leaving
behind him two sons, who both followed the occupation of
the father. The elder, who had the same christian name as
the father, died so early as 1676; but the other, Henry, survived
him several years. After that period Nuremberg produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
in this art more expert masters, who, by improving the
tools and devising cheaper methods of employing them, brought
it to a much higher degree of <span class="locked">perfection<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the art is of so modern date seems to be confirmed by
Zahn, who speaks of it as of a new employment carried on at
that time, particularly at Nuremberg. He describes the work-table
as well as the other instruments; and gives a figure of
the whole, which he appears to have considered as the <span class="locked">first<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span>.
It may be seen, however, from what I have already quoted,
that this invention does not belong entirely to the moderns;
and, to deny that the ancients were altogether unacquainted
with it, would be doing them an injustice. It was forgotten
and again revived; and this is the opinion of Caylus.</p>

<p>I must here remark, that before this invention there were
artists, who, with a diamond, cut or engraved figures on glass,
which were everywhere admired. Without entering, however,
into the history of diamonds, which would require more
materials than I have yet been able to collect, I will venture
to assert that the ancient artists employed diamond dust for
polishing or cutting other kinds of stones. <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> speaks of
this in so clear a manner that it cannot be doubted. The
same thing has been repeated by <span class="locked">Solinus<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span>, <span class="locked">Isidore<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span>, and Albertus
<span class="locked">Magnus<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span>, in a manner equally clear, and <span class="locked">Mariette<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span>
considers it as fully proved; but it does not appear that the
ancients made any attempts to cut this precious stone with its
own dust; I mean to give it different faces and to render it
brilliant. Whether they engraved on it in that manner I
cannot pretend to decide, as the greatest artists are not agreed
on the subject. <span class="locked">Mariette<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span> denies that they did; whereas
<span class="locked">Natter<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span> seems not to deny it altogether, and <span class="locked">Klotz<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> confidently
asserts it as a thing certain. But the last-mentioned author
knew nothing more of this circumstance than what he had
read in the above-quoted writers.</p>

<p>The question which properly belongs to my subject is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
whether the Greeks and the Romans used diamond pencils
for engraving on other stones. That many ancient artists
assisted their labour by them, or gave their work the finishing
touches, seems, according to Natter, to be shown by various
antique gems. But even allowing this to have been the
case (for at any rate I dare not contradict so eminent a connoisseur),
I must confess that I have found no proofs that the
ancients cut glass with a diamond. We are however acquainted
with the means employed by the old glaziers to cut
glass: they used for that purpose emery, sharp-pointed instruments
of the hardest steel, and a red-hot iron, by which
they directed the rents according to their pleasure.</p>

<p>The first mention of a diamond being used for writing on
glass occurs in the sixteenth century. Francis I. of France,
who was fond of the arts, sciences, and new inventions, wrote
the following lines with his diamond ring upon a pane of glass,
at the castle of Chambord, in order to let Anne de Pisseleu,
duchess of Estampes, know that he was jealous:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Souvent femme varie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mal habil qui s’y fie.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The historian recorded this not so much on account of the
admonition, which is not new, as because it was then thought
very ingenious to write upon <span class="locked">glass<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span>. About the year 1562,
festoons and other ornaments, cut with a diamond, were extremely
common on Venetian glasses, which at that period
were accounted the best. George Schwanhard the elder was
a great master in this <span class="locked">art<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span>; and in more modern times, John
Rost, an artist of Augsburg, ornamented in a very curious
manner with a diamond pencil, some drinking-glasses which
were purchased by the emperor Charles VI.</p>

<p>I now come to the art of etching on glass, which properly
was the subject of this article. As the acid which dissolves
siliceous earth, and also glass, was first discovered in the year
1771, by Scheele the <span class="locked">chemist<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span>, in fluor-spar, one might
imagine that the art of engraving with it upon glass could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
not be older. It has indeed been announced by many as a
new <span class="locked">invention<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span>; but it can be proved that it was discovered
as early as the year 1670, by the before-mentioned artist
Henry Schwanhard. We are told that some aquafortis having
fallen by accident upon his spectacles, the glass was corroded
by it; and that he thence learned to make a liquid by
which he could etch writing and figures upon plates of <span class="locked">glass<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span>.
How Schwanhard prepared this liquid I find nowhere mentioned;
but at present we are acquainted with no other acid
but that of fluor-spar which will corrode every kind of glass;
and it is very probable that his preparation was the same as
that known to some artists as a secret in 1721. The inventor
however employed it to a purpose different from that for
which it is used at present.</p>

<p>At present the glass is covered with a varnish, and those
figures which one intends to etch are traced out through it;
but Schwanhard, when the figures were formed, covered them
with varnish, and then by his liquid corroded the glass around
them; so that the figures, which remained smooth and clear,
appeared when the varnish was removed, raised from a dim or
dark ground. He perhaps adopted this method in order to
render his invention different from the art known long before
of cutting the figures on the glass as if engraven. Had he
been able to investigate properly what accident presented
to him, he might have enriched the arts with a discovery
which gave great reputation to a chemist a hundred years
after.</p>

<p>I mentioned this old method of etching in relief to our ingenious
Klindworth, who possesses great dexterity in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
arts, and requested him to try it. He drew a tree with oil
varnish and colours on a plate of glass, applied the acid to
the plate in the usual manner, and then removed the varnish.
By these means a bright, smooth figure was produced upon
a dim ground, which had a much better effect than those
figures that are cut into the glass. I recommend this process,
because I am of opinion that it may be brought to much
greater perfection; and M. Renard, that celebrated artist of
Strasburg, whose thermometers with glass scales, in which
the degrees and numbers are etched, have met with universal
approbation, was of the same opinion, when I mentioned the
method to him while he resided here, banished from his home
by the disturbances in his native country.</p>

<p>It is probable that Schwanhard and his scholars kept the
preparation of this liquid a secret, as the receipt for that purpose
was not made known till the year 1725, though it is
possible that one older may be found in some of those books
which treat on the arts. In the above-mentioned year, Dr.
John George Weygand, from Goldingen in Courland, sent to
the editor of a periodical work a receipt which had been
written out for him by Dr. Matth. Pauli of Dresden, then
deceased, who had etched, in this manner on glass, arms,
landscapes, and figures of various <span class="locked">kinds<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span>. We find by it that
a strong acid of nitre was used, which certainly disengages
the acid of fluor-spar, though the vitriolic acid is commonly
employed for that <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span>. That the Bohemian emerald or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
<i>hesphorus</i>, mentioned in the receipt, is green fluor-spar, cannot
be doubted, and will appear still more certain from the
history of this species of stone, as far as I am acquainted with
it, which I shall here insert.</p>

<p>In the works of the old mineralogists, fluor-spar is either
not mentioned, or is classed among their natural glasses and
precious stones; and in those of the first systematic writers
it is so mingled with quartz and calcareous and gypseous
spars, that it is impossible to discover it. The old German
miners, however, distinguished it so early as the sixteenth
century, and called it <i>fluss</i>; because they used it to accelerate
the fusion of ores that were difficult to be reduced to
that state. Agricola, who first remarked this, changed the
German name into <i>fluor</i>, an appellation, which, like many
others, formed by him from German words, such for example
as <i>quarzum</i> from <i>quarz</i>, <i>spatum</i> from <i>spat</i>, <i>wismuthum</i>, <i>zincum</i>,
<i>cobaltum</i>, &amp;c., became afterwards common. If a passage
of the ancients can be quoted that seems to allude to fluor-spar,
it is that of Theophrastus, where he says that there are
certain stones which, when added to silver, copper, and iron
ores, become <span class="locked">fluid<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span>. The first systematic writer who mentioned
this kind of stone as a particular genus, was Cronstedt.</p>

<p>Besides being known by its metallurgic use, fluor-spar is
known also by having the colours of some precious stones, so
that it may be sold, or at least shown as such to those who
are not expert judges; because the first time when heated in
the dark it shines with a bluish-green lustre. It is possible
that fluor-spar may have been among the number of that
great variety of stones which the ancients, with much astonishment,
tell us shone in the dark; though it is certain that
the principal part of them were only light-magnets, as they
are called, or such as retain for a certain period the light they
have absorbed in the day-time. The observation, however, that
fluor-spar emits light after it is heated, seems to have been
first made when artificial phosphorus excited the inquiry of
naturalists and chemists; and when they began to search in
their own country for stones which, in the property of emitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
light, might have a resemblance to the Bologna spar,
made known about the year 1630. It is well known that the
latter is prepared for that purpose by calcination. Stones of
the like kind were sought for; and among these fluor-spar,
which is not scarce in Germany.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the observation was made in the year 1676;
for in that year Elsholz informed the members of the Society
for investigating Nature, that he was acquainted with a phosphorus
which had its light neither from the sun nor from fire,
but which, when heated on a metal plate over glowing coals,
shone with a bluish-white lustre; so that by strewing the
powder of it over paper, one might form luminous writing.
I doubt much whether this experiment was ever tried; at
least I find no further account of it in the papers of the Society,
nor in the re-publication of the above author’s first
dissertation, which appeared in <span class="locked">1681<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span>.</p>

<p>As far as I know, Kirchmaier, professor at Wittenberg, was
the first who disclosed the secret, in the year <span class="locked">1679<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span>. Both
call this phosphorus the smaragdine; because the ancients
speak much of luminous emeralds, and because green fluor-spar
is often exhibited as an emerald. Kirchmaier calls this
mineral also <i>hesperus</i> and <i>vesperugo</i>; and these names have
been often given since to fluor-spar, as in the receipt before-mentioned
for making a liquid to etch on glass. Kirchmaier’s
information, however, must have been very little known; for
the Jesuit Casatus, who, in 1684, wrote his Treatise on Fire,
was not acquainted with it, as he has inserted only the words
of Elsholz. This observation must have been new to Leibnitz
himself, and to the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, in 1710;
for the former then mentioned it to the Society as a philosophical
<span class="locked">novelty<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span>.</p>

<p>I shall remark, in the last place, that the manufacturing of
vessels and ornaments of every kind from solid fluor-spar was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
begun in Derbyshire in the year <span class="locked">1765<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span>. The articles formed
of it are in England called spar ornaments, and sometimes
<i>blue John</i>. Many beautiful colours must, as is said, be brought
forward by means of fire. But the heat must be applied with
great caution; for fluor-spar, as is well known, by a strong
and particularly a sudden heating, cracks, and loses its transparency.
Since writing the above, I find that M. <span class="locked">Raspe<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span>
denies this bringing forward of colours by fire.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="soap">SOAP.</h2>

<p>That the first express mention of soap occurs in Pliny and
Galen, and that the former declares it to be an invention of
the Gauls, though he prefers the German to the Gallic <span class="locked">soap<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span>,
has already been remarked by many. Pliny says that <span class="locked">soap<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span>
was made of tallow and ashes; that the best was made of
goats’ tallow and the ashes of the beech-tree, and that there
were two kinds of it, hard and soft. The author of a work
on simple medicines, which is ascribed to Galen, but which
however does not seem to have been written by that author,
and of which only a Latin translation has been printed, speaks
of soap being made by a mixture of oxen, goats’, or sheep’s
tallow, and a lye of ashes strengthened with quicklime. He
says the German soap was the purest, the fattest, and the
best, and that the next in quality was the <span class="locked">Gallic<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span>. This account
corresponds more exactly with the process used in Germany
at present; whereas the French use mineral alkali, and
instead of tallow, employ oil, which appears to be a later invention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Pliny in his description does not speak of quicklime;
but as he mentions a mixture of goats’ tallow and quicklime
a little before, it is probable that the use of the latter
was then known at Rome. Gallic and German soap are often
mentioned by later <span class="locked">writers<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span>, as well as by the Arabians, sometimes
on account of their external use as a medicine, and
sometimes on account of their use in washing clothes. The
latter purpose is that for which soap is principally employed
in modern times; but it does not seem to have been the cause
of German soap being introduced at Rome. Washing there
was the occupation of indigent scourers, who did not give
themselves much trouble concerning foreign commodities.
The German soap, with which, as Pliny tells us, the Germans
coloured their hair red, was imported to Rome for the use of
the fashionable Roman ladies and their gallants. There is
no doubt that the <i>pilæ Mattiacæ</i>, which Martial recommends
as a preventive of gray <span class="locked">hair<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span>; the <i>caustica spuma</i> with which
the Germans dyed their <span class="locked">hair<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span>; and the Batavian froth or lather
which the Romans employed for colouring <span class="locked">theirs<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span>, were
German soap. It is probable that the Germans tinged it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
those plants which were sent to Rome for dyeing the <span class="locked">hair<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span>;
and according to the modern manner of speaking, it was more
properly a kind of pomade than soap.</p>

<p>It appears that the Romans at first considered hair-soap as
an ointment made from ashes; for we read in various passages
of ancient authors, that the hair was dyed by means of
ashes, or an ointment made of ashes and a certain kind of oil.
It is however possible that they may have had such an ointment,
which undoubtedly would be of a saponaceous nature,
before they were acquainted with the German soap, or that
they imitated the German pomade with different <span class="locked">variations<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span>.</p>

<p>As soap is everywhere used for washing at present, a question
arises what substitutes were employed before it was invented.
Those with which I am acquainted I shall mention
and endeavour to illustrate. They are all still used, though
not in general; and they are all of a soapy nature, or at least
have the same effects as soap; so that we may say the ancients
used soap without knowing it.</p>

<p>Our soap is produced by a mixture of lixivious salts and
tallow, by which means the latter becomes soluble in water.
The greater part of the dirt on our linen and clothes consists
of oily perspiration or grease, or dust which that grease attracts,
and which either cannot be washed out, or, but very
imperfectly, by water alone. But if warm water, to which
lixivious salts have in any manner been added, be taken, and
if dirty cloth be rubbed in it, the greasy dirt unites with the
salts, becomes saponaceous, and is so far soluble in water that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
it may be washed out. There are also natural juices which
are of a soapy quality, in the state in which we find them,
and which can be employed in the stead of artificial soap.
Of this kind is the gall of animals and the sap of many plants.
The former being less strong in its effects on account of its
slimy nature, is used at present particularly for coloured stuffs,
the dye of which is apt to fade. As far as I know, however,
it was not employed by the <span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span>, but it is certain that in
washing they used saponaceous plants.</p>

<p>In the remotest periods it appears that clothes were cleaned
by being rubbed or stamped upon in water, without the addition
of any substance whatever. We are told by Homer,
that Nausicaa and her attendants washed their clothes by
treading upon them with their feet in pits, into which they
had collected <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span>. The epithet black, which the poet
gives to the water, might induce one to conjecture that it
had been mixed with ashes, which would convert it into a
lye; but where were the ashes to be found? Had they
brought them along with them, the bard, where he before
enumerates everything that they carried with them, and even
oil, would not have failed to mention them; and such a conjecture
is rendered entirely groundless by his applying the
same epithet to pure water, in other places, where nothing
can be supposed to have coloured <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span>. Water, when it stands
in deep pits, reflects so few rays of light, that in a poetical
sense it may very properly be called black.</p>

<p>We find however mention made at later periods of ashes,
and a lye of ashes employed for washing; but I think very
seldom, and I do not know how old the use of them may be.
According to Julius Pollux, <i>konia</i>, mentioned by Aristophanes
and Plato, was a substance used for washing; and he
says expressly, that we are to understand by it a lye of ashes.
This I mention for the sake of those, who, like me, place
little confidence in the terms of art given in dictionaries.
With the above lye, oil- and wine-jars were <span class="locked">cleaned<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span>; and it
was employed also for washing the images of the <span class="locked">gods<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span>.
The method of strengthening the lye by means of unslaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
lime was known, at any rate, in the time of Paulus Ægineta;
but it appears that the Romans were not acquainted with the
salt itself, which is procured by dissolving common wood-ashes
in water: I mean, they did not understand the art of
producing it in a dry solid form, or of boiling potashes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, that fixed lixivious salt, the mineral
which nature presents in many of the southern countries, was
long known and used in washing. This was the <i>nitrum</i>, or,
as the people of Attica pronounced it, the <i>litrum</i>, of the ancients,
as has already been remarked by <span class="locked">others<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span>. It would
however be worth the trouble to investigate the proofs still
further. By examining them with more mineralogical and
chemical knowledge than have hitherto been employed for
that purpose, they might be further strengthened, and serve
to illustrate many obscure passages. For my part, I have
neither leisure nor room here to undertake such a task, though
I have collected many observations relative to that subject.
It is certain at any rate, that the ancients employed <i>nitrum</i>
for washing, and it is evident from the testimony of various
authors, that it was much used in the <span class="locked">baths<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the people of Egypt, in the time of Pliny, made mineral
alkali also from the ashes of some plants, we have reason
to conclude, because he says that it was necessary to put
the Egyptian nitre into vessels well-corked, else it became
liquid. Natural alkali is never liable to do so, unless it be
very much burnt; and as no reason is assigned for its assuming
that form, we may believe that the Egyptian alkali
was the strongly burnt ashes of those plants which are still
used in Egypt for making salt, and perhaps the same with
which the Spaniards were made acquainted by the Arabians,
and which they cultivate for making soda.</p>

<p>Strabo speaks of an alkaline water in Armenia, which was
used by the scourers for washing <span class="locked">clothes<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span>. Of this kind
also must have been the lake Ascanius, which is mentioned
by <span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span>, Antigonus <span class="locked">Carystius<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span>. It is worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
of remark, that the ancients made ointments of this mineral
alkali and oil, but not hard soap, though by these means
they approached nearer to the invention than the old Germans
in their use of wood-ashes; for dry solid soap can be
made with more ease from the mineral than the vegetable
alkali; and when Hungarian, French, and German soap are
of equal goodness, the last does more credit to the manufacturers
because they cannot employ the mineral alkali. I
shall here observe, that this alkali was used for washing by
the Hebrews, and that it occurs in the sacred writings under
the name of <i>borith</i><a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>.</p>

<p>The cheapest however, and the most common article used
for washing, was the urine of men and animals. When this
excrement becomes old, the alkali disengages itself, which
may be perceived by its fœtid smell; and such alkalised urine
being warmed, and employed to wash greasy clothes, produces
the same effects as the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients. It is
still used for the like purpose in our cloth manufactories.</p>

<p>To procure a supply of it, the ancient washers and scourers
placed at the corners of the streets, vessels which they
carried away after they had been filled by the passengers,
who were at liberty to use them; and the practice of having
such conveniences was certainly more decent than that of
employing the walls of churches and other buildings, which
the police of Dresden forbade some years ago, but with no
effect. At Rome, that which at present spoils and renders
filthy our noblest edifices, was converted to use. When
clothes were washed, they were trod upon with the feet, as
was the case in the cloth manufactories at Leeds, Halifax, and
other places of England, where the urine was collected by servants,
and sold by measure to the manufacturers under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
name of <i>old lant</i>. On account of the disagreeable smell attending
their employment, scourers at Rome were obliged
to reside either in the suburbs or in some of the unfrequented
<span class="locked">streets<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span>.</p>

<p>My readers here will undoubtedly call to remembrance the
source of taxation devised by the emperor Vespasian, who, as
his historians tell us, <i>urinæ vectigal commentus est</i><a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>. It is not
certainly known in what manner this impost was regulated.
Did the emperor declare that article, which was not <i>subterraneum
rarius</i>, to be a regale as a <i>res derelicta</i>, so that the
scourers were obliged to pay him what he thought a reasonable
sum proportioned to the benefit which they derived from
it? Or was it imposed only as a poll-tax? For every tax
upon anything indispensably necessary to all, is, to speak in
the language of finance, the same as what is called a poll-tax,
or a tax paid by every one who has a head. The latter conjecture
is the most probable, especially as this tax continued
two centuries, till the time of Anastasius, and as we read also
of <i>vectigal pro urina jumentorum et canum</i>, which was exacted
from every person who kept cattle. Vespasian therefore
was not fortunate in the choice of a name for his tribute,
which on that account must have been undoubtedly more
detested. A poll-tax at present is called by those who do
not speak favourably of it, the Turkish-tax, because the
Turks impose it on all unbelievers. When it was introduced
by Louis XIV. in 1695, he called it <i>la capitation</i>.</p>

<p>Of plants with a saponaceous juice, the ancients, at any
rate, used one instead of soap; but it is difficult or rather
impossible to define it. I shall not therefore content myself
merely with transcribing the passages where it is mentioned,
but I shall arrange whatever I can find respecting it in such
a manner, as, according to my opinion, the names of plants
ought to be explained in dictionaries.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The above is all that the ancients have told us respecting
this plant. The information is indeed very scanty, and at
the same time it is not altogether certain; but even if it
were, it would be sufficient only to confute some conjectures,
but not to establish the systematic name of the plant. I call
the properties of it described to us uncertain: first, because
I do not know whether Pliny did not mean to distinguish the
wild plant from that which was cultivated, and many have
understood as alluding to the former that which I have applied
to both: secondly, because the words of Theophrastus,
being in one passage evidently corrupted, will admit of various
constructions; and because in another, on account of
some exceptions, of which he speaks, they appear at least to
me unintelligible: thirdly, because Pliny, who gives us the
best account of it, is the only author who calls the <i>struthium</i>
or soap-plant <i>radicula</i>, a name by which is rather to be understood
a dye-plant of the same kind as madder. We have
reason therefore to suspect that he has confounded the properties
of the two plants, especially as the fourth property
was ascribed by others to a <i>Rubia</i>, <i>Asperula</i>, or <i>Galium</i>,
which was cultivated in Syria, and named often <i>radicula
Syriaca</i>. On the other hand, this diminutive is very ill-suited
to a root which Pliny himself calls large.</p>

<p>The words of that author, “tingenti, quicquid sit cum quo
decoquatur,” have been by some explained as if he meant that
the <i>struthium</i> was a dye-plant, though as a soapy plant it
must have been destitute of colour; and they have hence
deduced a proof that Pliny confounded the <i>struthium</i> with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the <i>radicula</i> used in dyeing. On the other hand, Hardouin
reads <i>unguentis</i> instead of <i>tingenti</i>. He assures us that he
found the former in manuscripts, and is of opinion that the
sap of the <i>struthium</i> was used also for ointments.</p>

<p>In my opinion, however, <i>tingenti</i> must be retained; and
the meaning is that when cloth was to be dyed it was necessary
to prepare it for that purpose by soaking it and washing
it with the sap of this plant. This he expressly tells us himself;
“tingentibus et radicula lanas præparat.” It is probable
that the ancient dyers mixed their dye-liquors with the juice
of the <i>struthium</i>, for the same purpose as bran and the seeds
of fenugreek are added to dye-liquors at present; that is, to
render them thicker and more slimy, in order that the colouring
particles may be longer and more equally suspended
in or diffused through <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span>. The words <i>quidquid sit cum
quo decoquatur</i> will now become intelligible. Whatever may
be employed for dyeing, says the author, the addition of the
juice of the <i>struthium</i> is serviceable.</p>

<p>As what has been said contains nothing that can enable
us to determine the genus of the <i>struthium</i> according to the
rules of botany, we may be allowed to conjecture that it was
one of those plants still used for the like purpose in Italy and
other neighbouring countries. Fuchs thinks it must have
been the <i>Saponaria officinalis</i> (soap-wort), the roots of
which indeed contain a saponaceous juice that readily changes
the saliva into froth. The root was employed for that purpose
by the impostor in Lucian; and the juice is used at
present for cleaning wool and cloth. In the Helvetian Alps,
the sheep, before they are shorn, are washed with a decoction
of the plant and its roots; and with a mixture of ashes
it serves for cleaning linen. The taste of it is so sharp, that
it is compared by some to that of the small burnet-saxifrage.</p>

<p>This <i>Saponaria officinalis</i> however differs too much from
the remaining <span class="locked">properties<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span> of the <i>struthium</i>. Its root is as
thick only as a quill, or at most as one’s finger. The stem,
which is three feet in height, throws out many branches, and
cannot be called <i>caulis ferulaceus, tenuis</i>. It is not rough
and prickly, and, instead of growing in poor rocky soil, it is
rather fond of deep ground and the borders of corn-fields.</p>

<p>We may therefore conjecture with more probability that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the <i>Gypsophila Struthium</i>, <span class="locked">Linn.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span>, a plant still used for
washing in the lower part of Italy and Spain, is the <i>struthium</i>
of the ancients. This opinion acquires some strength by its
being adopted among the Italians and Spaniards; and because
the plant, as Pliny says, grows in a rocky soil and on
the mountains. It is also still called <i>lanaria</i> by the Calabrian
peasants. It has a tender stem; its leaves are so like
those of the olive-tree that they might be compared to them
by those who are not botanists; and its root is large, but it
is neither rough nor prickly. This contradiction may be
accounted for by supposing that Pliny, through a mistake, of
which I have already accused him, ascribed falsely to the
soap-plant the prickly or rough leaves of the dye-plant which
had an affinity to madder. But even after this explanation
there still remains to be got over a dubious passage of
Theophrastus, who indeed seems to make the plant prickly
also.</p>

<p>I do not therefore place entire confidence in this opinion;
but suspect rather that we shall receive from the East an account
of a plant, still used there, which will correspond more
exactly with the soap-plant described by Pliny. I am inclined
to think that I have already found some precursory
information respecting it in Bauhin, who says that in Syria
there is another kind of soap-plant, which has prickly leaves
like the thistle, and a thick root of a sharp acrid taste. The
root, he adds, was employed for washing clothes and wool;
and the confectioners of Damascus formed of it, with honey
and wine, a kind of sweetmeat which appeared as white as if
it had been made of the finest flour and sugar, and which
was so hard that it could scarcely be broken with the teeth.
This plant seems to belong to those, the cultivation of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
was abandoned in Europe, after the use of them was rendered
superfluous by newer discoveries.</p>

<p>That the ancients employed their <i>struthium</i> for washing
wool is confirmed by various authorities; but I do not
remember to have found any evidence of its being used for
cleaning clothes which had been worn. Salmasius however
quotes a passage from the works, unfortunately never printed,
of the old chemist Zosimus, in which he gives directions for
restoring, by means of the soap-plant, the lustre of pearls
which have become <span class="locked">yellow<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span>.</p>

<p>The meal of many kinds of seeds may be used for washing,
as well as various kinds of bran. That of almonds, which
on account of its oil is remarkably soft, is employed at present
for washing the hands by those who are desirous of
having a white delicate skin. Cloth, the colours of which
easily fade, and which will neither endure soap nor hard
rubbing, may be washed extremely well with bran. Our
fullers, therefore, and stocking manufacturers use oat-, barley- and
bean-meal, especially when they wish the cloth to be
slowly milled. Whether the ancients employed bran in the
same manner I have not had an opportunity of examining.
I am rather inclined to think that they did; and there is a
passage of Galen which seems to allude to the use of <span class="locked">bean-meal<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span>.
In all probability the beans of the ancients were the
smallest and roundest variety of our horse-beans, or those
used as fodder.</p>

<p>In the last place, the ancients, at those periods of which I
speak, used fullers-earth much oftener than it is used at
present. Till the countries where it was procured be described
by travellers who unite a knowledge of antiquities
with skill in mineralogy, the species of this earth, mentioned
in the works of ancient authors, cannot be distinguished with
accuracy. But from the purposes to which they were applied,
we can with certainty conclude that they must have been
partly of the nature of marl and partly of the nature of soapstone.</p>

<p>According to the then usual method of washing, by which
the clothes were stamped with the feet, the <i>cretæ fulloniæ</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
<span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span> calls them, acted in the same manner as our fullers-earth
employed at present, partly by scouring and partly by
absorbing the greasy dirt. The ancients, after their manner,
gave them names only from the countries where they were
produced; and hence we find mention made of <i>terra Cimolia</i><a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>,
<i>Chia</i><a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>, <i>Lemnia</i><a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>, <i>Sarda</i><a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>, <i>Umbria</i><a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>, <i>Samia</i>, <i>Tymphæa</i><a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>, and
others. Many of them, like that brought from Sardinia, could
not be used in cleaning coloured stuffs; and for this reason,
perhaps, because some colours would not stand hard scouring,
or endure their caustic nature.</p>

<p>The fullers, however, did not use these earths merely for
washing, but also for whitening many kinds of cloth. This
was done by rubbing fine white earth into the cloth, in the
same manner as soldiers do to give some parts of their dress a
brighter appearance. A like process is employed by glovers
and those who wash or clean leather. The earth used by the
latter is a yellowish-white iron-ochre, called from the purpose
to which it is applied <span class="locked">collar-earth<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span>. When a perfect white
was required, a kind of white potters-clay or marl was employed;
and the closer it adhered to the cloth, and the less
easily it could be rubbed out, it was so much the better.
The poor at Rome rubbed it over their clothes on festivals,
in order that they might appear <span class="locked">brighter<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></span>.</p>

<p>It deserves here to be particularly remarked, that some of
these earths, such as that of Chios, were employed in the baths
instead of nitrum; and this is the case in the Levant still.
De la Valle extols in this respect a kind of reddish earth, and
says that people of the first distinction never bathe without it.
Perfumes are often mixed with it; and it is formed into small
balls, which when used are suffered to dissolve in the water.
Different kinds of vessels, and particularly those in which wine
and oil had been kept, were cleansed with these earths <span class="locked">also<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Glass flasks which have had oil in them, cannot be cleansed
better or more speedily than by shaking in them a mixture of
fullers-earth or potters-clay. When these are not to be had,
blotting-paper may be used. The oil is absorbed by the earth
or the paper, and with them can be easily washed out.</p>

<p>To render cloth perfectly white, it was also fumigated with
sulphur by the fullers, who were not ignorant that many colours
were destroyed by its <span class="locked">vapours<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span>. We are told by Apuleius
that the wife of a scourer concealed her gallant under
a vessel of basket-work, over which cloth used to be laid to
whiten by the effects of sulphur kindled under it. Our
washer-women employ a cask in this mode of bleaching, and
our clothiers a small close apartment, in which the wet cloth
is suspended upon hooks.</p>

<p>Pliny has described the method of washing used at Rome,
but many things respecting it appear to me <span class="locked">obscure<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span>. The
cloth was first washed with Sardian earth; it was then fumigated
with sulphur, and afterwards rinsed with real Cimolian
earth. The word <i>desquamatur</i> was undoubtedly a term of
art, which cannot be further explained, because we are unacquainted
with the operation to which it alludes. Pliny seems
to have been particular in mentioning real Cimolian earth,
because the false kind became black by the steam of the sulphur
which the cloth absorbed. Was it adulterated with
some metallic oxide or with white lead? It was dear enough
to induce people to mix it with such articles; and in that
case it must necessarily have become black.</p>

<p>The expression <i>funditur sulphure</i> seems to be attended
with no less difficulty. In comparing the different readings,
I find that the oldest editions have <i>offunditur</i>, which has been
changed into <i>effunditur</i>, and lastly into <i>funditur</i>. It is probable
however that instead of <i>offunditur</i> we ought to read
<i>offenditur</i>, which would make the whole clear. I am much
surprised that this reading was not adopted by Hardouin.
As Pliny says in other parts of his work “offendit stomachum,”
and “offendit aciem oculorum,” he might undoubtedly have
applied that word to the earth and its colour.</p>

<p>Fast colours, which the acid of sulphur might render pale,
but could not entirely destroy, would by washing with Cimolian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
earth be improved or rather restored, as the earth would
absorb and carry off the acid. There was also another kind
of earth (<i>saxum</i>) which was useful in the preparation of cloth
fumigated with sulphur, but which injured the dye, probably
because it was too calcareous, and which was perhaps our
common chalk.</p>

<p>I do not intend to treat here of the whole art of Roman
fullers, which belongs rather to the history of weaving or
manufacturing cloth in general; but I hope I shall be forgiven
if I add the few following observations. The fullers
received the cloth as it came from the loom, in order that it
might be scoured, walked and smoothed. It was walked by
being stamped upon with the feet. The rough wool raised by
this operation was combed off, partly with the skin of a hedgehog,
and partly with the tops of some plants of the thistle
kind, in order to give the cloth a nap. Shearing seems not
then to have been known: I have at least met with no passage
where it is mentioned: and the case is the same with
the use of presses; which, in my opinion, were not invented
till the sixteenth century. The whole process of smoothing
seems to have consisted in making the wool or nap lie as
evenly as possible one way, which certainly must have given
to the cloth a much better appearance.</p>

<p>As cloth at present is more dressed and shorn on one side
than another, the ancient fullers prepared theirs in the like
manner; so that clothes could be turned, after the inside of
them had been new dressed. Whether they made felt, also,
I have not yet inquired; but I conjecture that the manufacturing
it was the occupation of those called <i>lanarii</i>, <i>coactores</i>,
and <i>coactilarii</i>.</p>

<p>The occupation of the fullers was at Rome very extensive,
and afforded employment to a great number of people, but it
at length entirely decayed. Schöttgen is of opinion that it
belongs to those arts which have been lost. But other writers
have declared arts which are exercised now in greater perfection
than formerly to be lost, merely because they were not
acquainted with them; or because, on account of the alterations
they have undergone, they did not know where to find
them. All the different operations of fulling have become so
complex by new methods, improvements, and inventions, that
they can no longer be conducted by one man; and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
business has for that reason been separated or divided into
several distinct branches.</p>

<p>The scouring of cloth when it comes from the loom, was,
together with walking, separated from the rest, after the invention
of the walk-mill. How old that invention may be, I
cannot accurately determine; but we find it mentioned in the
beginning of the thirteenth, and even at the end of the tenth
century. Such a mill formerly was call <i>fullencium</i>, or <i>molendinum
cum fullone</i><a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>. The dressing and smoothing of cloth,
since the invention of shearing and pressing, requires so much
art, that these operations can be performed only by skilful
workmen, who are called cloth-shearers or cloth-dressers.
The scouring of cloth dirtied in manufacturing, is by the invention
of soap, bleaching, and other processes, become so
easy that it can be performed by women. The Romans for
the most part wore a white dress made in the form of a cloak;
which indeed, as shirts were not then used, must have often
stood in need of being <span class="locked">cleaned<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span>. We, on the other hand,
wear in general short close clothes of coloured cloth; which
by the fashion in which they are made, are less exposed to
be dirtied; and we are more accustomed also to use clothes
of linen or cotton, which can be washed with much less labour.
Felt, which is employed almost for hats alone, is manufactured
by our hat-makers. Whoever takes a general view
of all these employments together, will be readily convinced
that they maintain more people, and in a better manner, than
the whole <i>ars fullonia</i> did at Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
[The principal kinds of soap manufactured in this country are,&mdash;white
soap, composed chiefly of tallow and soda, but for
some purposes of olive oil and soda; yellow soap, made of
tallow, rosin and soda, a little palm oil being occasionally
added; mottled soap, formed of tallow, kitchen stuff and soda,
its peculiar appearance being communicated by dispersing
the lees through it towards the end of the operation; brown
soap, made from palm oil, rosin and soda. Soft soap is made
with potash and drying oils, either alone or mixed with tallow,
and other coarse fatty matters. The fatty matter is mixed with
the alkaline ley, and the whole boiled gently for some time, until
the fat is completely saponified, which may be known by its
becoming clear and transparent, and its susceptibility of being
drawn into long threads. A quantity of common salt is then
added to the boiling mixture, until the soap loses its thready
character, and drops from the spatula in short thick lumps.
The soap is then removed, either after cooling, or at once ladled
out. Common fatty matters, as tallow, fat-oils, &amp;c., are compounds
of a fatty acid with a base, thus resembling salts; the
base is a peculiar sweet principle, glycerine; by ebullition with
the caustic lye, the neutral fatty compound is decomposed,
the fatty acid combining with the base soda, and forming the
soap, whilst the glycerine with the excess of alkali remains in
the liquid.</p>

<p>The so-called <i>silicated</i> soap, of which large quantities are
now manufactured, is made by combining silicate of soda with
hard soap in the hot and pasty state; in this way from 10 to
30 per cent. of the silicate may be introduced. Such soap
possesses, according to Dr. Ure, very powerful detergent
qualities, but it is apt to feel hard and somewhat gritty in
use. The silicated soda is obtained by boiling ground flints
in a strong caustic lye. Many substances are used to adulterate
soap, such as potatoe-starch, clay, &amp;c., for which <i>improvements</i>,
as they are termed, numerous patents have been
granted in this country.</p>

<p>In Great Britain the hard kind of soap is chiefly made at
Liverpool and London, but in considerable quantities also at
Runcorn, Bristol, Brentford, Hull, Bromsgrove, Plymouth
and Sethwick, and at Glasgow and Leith in Scotland; the
soft soap is made principally at Liverpool, Glasgow and Bradford;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
and silicated soap is likewise extensively manufactured
at Liverpool.</p>

<p>From the excise returns, it appears that 140,712,535 pounds
of hard, 9,788,851 pounds of soft, and 3,921,862 pounds of
silicated soap were made in England in 1841; and 10,708,464
pounds of hard, and 4,535,030 pounds of soft soap in Scotland;
making in all 169,666,742 pounds, which is an increase
of about 30 per cent. since <span class="locked">1832<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span>.</p>

<p>The excise duty on soap was first imposed in Great Britain
in 1711, when it was fixed at 1<i>d.</i> per pound. It was raised
in 1713 to 1½<i>d.</i> per pound; and again, in 1782, when hard
and soft soap were first distinguished, the former being rated
at 2¼<i>d.</i>, and the latter at 1¾<i>d.</i> per pound. In 1816, that on
hard soap was increased to 3<i>d.</i> per pound. But since May 31,
1833, the duty has been 1½<i>d.</i> per pound on hard soap, and
1<i>d.</i> per pound on soft. In 1839, the number of soap manufacturers
in England was 177; in Scotland 19; and in Ireland
183. Each requires an annual license, costing 4<i>l.</i></p>

<p>An allowance of duty is made on soap used in the woollen,
silk, flax, and cotton manufactures, which in 1841 was granted
on 10,190,160 pounds of hard, and 9,090,184 pounds of soft
soap; the allowances amounting to 78,112<i>l.</i> In the same
year the net amount yielded by the soap-duty to the public
revenue was 815,864<i>l.</i> Ireland is not subject to the soap-duty.</p>

<p>The soap-maker was formerly subjected to an arbitrary
and vexatious interference from the excise; but of late years
the regulations have been greatly improved, and there is now
no superintendence of the process of manufacture, which may
be conducted in any way and of any material.]</p>

These lines are generally explained in this manner:&mdash;“Dye thy hair with
soap, and it will become more beautiful than that of the Germans.” But
in this case all the wit of the advice is lost; and the expression, “eris
cultior quam comæ captivæ,” seems to me to be very improper. I should
rather translate them as follows:&mdash;“Let the Germans dye their hair with
pomade; as they are now subdued, thou mayst ornament thyself better with
a peruke made of the hair of these captives.” This was a piece of delicate
flattery to Domitian and the Roman pride. That prince thought he had conquered
the Germans; and the most beautiful German hair, that which was
not dyed, could be procured, therefore, at Rome, much easier than before.

Tertullian, lib. ii. <i>ad uxor.</i> 8, p. 641, seem to have been only hair-dressers,

It appears, also, that the <i>toga</i>, when it came from the hands of the weaver,
was quite ready for use; and we therefore never read of tailors, but when
torn clothes were to be mended. The <i>toga</i> had no sleeves, and perhaps
no seam. If it was stitched along the edges before, half-way up, the assistance
of a tailor would not be necessary for that purpose. It was bound
round the body with a girdle, and fastened with clasps. Such a mantle
could be easily made and easily scoured. One may now readily comprehend
why the Roman authors never mention cloth manufactories, or cloth,
among the articles of commerce, but speak only of clothes; and why we
never read of cloth being measured.</p></div>

<h2 id="madder">MADDER.</h2>

<p>This plant, the root of which is either dried and bruised, or
used fresh, for dyeing red, has a weak, square, jointed stem;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and rises to the height of eight feet when supported, otherwise
it creeps along the ground. At each joint there are from
four to six leaves, about three inches in length, almost an inch
broad in the middle, and pointed at both ends. The upper
side of the leaves is smooth; but the middle nerve of the under
side is armed with small rough prickles; and others of the
same kind may be found on the stem. On this account, the
leaves, which drop annually, adhere readily to other bodies,
like those of the <i>asperugo</i>. The branches, which in June bear
flowers divided into four yellow leaves, proceed from the joints.
The fruit, a kind of berry, which, towards the time of its ripening,
though that seldom happens among us, is first of a
brownish colour, and then black, contains a round seed. The
roots grow sometimes to the thickness of one’s finger, push
themselves deep into the earth, are surrounded by many small
fibres, have a yellowish-red pith, and are covered with a black
bark or rind. This plant grows wild in the Levant, as well
as in Italy, the southern parts of France, and in Switzerland.
The cultivated kind is well known, and is propagated with
much advantage in various countries of Europe.</p>

<p>When one compares this short description with what Dioscorides
says of a plant which he calls <i>ereuthodanon</i>, it will be
readily seen that he meant our madder. He even compares
its long square stem, armed with a great many hooks, to that
of the <i>asperugo</i>; and he tells us that the leaves stand in the
form of a star around the joints. The fruit was at first green,
then red, and lastly black. The thin long roots, adds he,
which are red, serve for dyeing; and on that account the
cultivated kind (he must therefore have been acquainted with
the wild sort) is reared with much benefit in Galilee, around
Ravenna in Italy and in Caria, where it is planted either
among the olive-trees, or in fields destined for that purpose.
It is remarked in some manuscripts, that this plant had a
name given it by the Romans, which, as Marcellus Virgil
observes, meant the same thing as <i>Rubia sativa</i>, and that it
was called in Etruria <i>Lappa minor</i>, doubtless because, like
the bur, it adhered to other bodies. On account of the colour
which it communicated, it was called also sometimes <i>cinnabaris</i><a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
In opposition to this asserted identity I find only one doubt;
namely, that among those plants which, on account of the
position of their leaves, were called <i>stellatæ</i>, and which were
all so like that we must reduce them to one natural order,
there are more sorts, the roots of which dye red, and which
on that account are very improperly called wild madder.
Why, therefore, should the plant of Dioscorides be our madder,
and not some other plant of the like nature? For this
reason, in my opinion: because the ancients, who were acquainted
with all these plants, which grew wild in their lands,
were equally prudent as the moderns, and cultivated that
kind only which was the most productive or beneficial, viz.
our <i>Rubia tinctorum</i>.</p>

<p>This opinion will be strengthened by comparing the accounts
given of that plant by other ancient writers. Theophrastus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
agrees almost perfectly with Dioscorides; and adds,
that it did not grow upright, but was fond of reclining. The
comparison, therefore, with the leaves of ivy cannot be just;
but that I shall leave to the critics. Pliny says expressly,
that the <i>erythrodanum</i> or <i>ereuthodanum</i> was in his mother-tongue
called <i>rubia</i>; and that its red roots were used to dye
wool and leather <span class="locked">red<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the middle ages this plant was called <i>varantia</i>, a name
which must have arisen from <i>verantia</i>. The latter means the
real, genuine dye; as <i>aurantia</i> signified a golden yellow. Till
the year 1736, this plant was little regarded, except among
dyers, farmers and merchants, who purchased it from the
farmers, in order to sell it to the dyers with profit; and
among a few herb-dealers and physicians, who, on the authority
of the ancients, ascribed to it eminent virtues, which
others doubted or altogether denied. In the above year, however,
a property of it was discovered by accident, as usual,
which rendered it an object of more attention. John Belchier,
an English surgeon, having dined with a cotton-printer, observed
that the bones of the pork which was brought to the
table were red. As he seemed surprised at this circumstance,
his host assured him that the redness was occasioned by the
swine feeding on the water mixed with bran in which the
cotton cloth was boiled, and which was coloured by the
madder used in printing it. <span class="locked">Belchier<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span>, to whom this effect
was new, convinced himself by experiments that the red
colour of the bones had arisen from the madder employed in
printing the cotton, and from no other cause; and he communicated
his discovery to the Royal Society, in a paper
which was printed in their Transactions.</p>

<p>This singularity was now soon known to all the naturalists,
several of whom made new experiments, the result of
which brought to light many truths useful to physiology.
Besides the roots of madder, those of the <i>Galium</i> (yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
ladies-bed-straw) and other plants which have an affinity to
madder, produce the like effects; but this is the case neither
with saffron nor woad, nor with many others much used in
dyeing. The colouring takes place soonest in young animals;
and is strongest where the bones are hardest and thickest.
On the other hand, it does not reach the soft parts; appears
only a little in the milk; and in general is not perceptible in
the animal <span class="locked">juices<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span>.</p>

<p>As the English calico-printers were acquainted with this
effect of madder before it was known to naturalists, it is not
improbable that it was known much sooner in other places,
where the plant has been much cultivated and used since the
earliest periods. From what J. E. Stief says, we have reason
to believe that the people in the neighbourhood of Breslau,
his native city, who gave the stalks of the madder plant to
their cows instead of straw, must have first discovered that it
possessed the property of communicating a red colour to the
<span class="locked">bones<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span>.</p>

<p>As many truths not yet investigated by means of new
experiments, and which on that account have not yet been
acknowledged, are concealed among the evidently false assertions
to be found in the works of the ancients, and as these
works were thrown aside too early, before their contents were
properly examined, I was induced to suspect that some hints
of this colouring property might also be mentioned in them,
which indeed is the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
We learn from the works of Galen and Dioscorides, that
the ancient physicians remarked that the use of certain roots,
which they administered to their patients, communicated a
colour to their urine and excrements; and this observation
has been repeated by Cardan, Thurneisser, Porta, Castor,
Durantes, and others. Had those ancient physicians, who
often prescribed these roots, and paid attention to the colour
of the excrements of their patients, been accustomed to open
their bodies when they died under their hands, they would
have perhaps remarked, in human bones, what was observed
long after in the bones of animals, when the roots were no
longer used in medicine; and what, if I am not mistaken, was
never yet observed in the bones of the human <span class="locked">species<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span>.</p>

<p>Böhmer, who made researches respecting the antiquity of
this observation, found it neither in Rombert. Dodonæus,
Mich. Ettmuller, Morin, Will. Salmon, nor others, who, however,
speak of coloured urine. In his opinion the oldest writer
who speaks of coloured bones is Mizaldus; but what he relates
is all taken from the treatise of Lemnius De Miraculis
Occultis Naturæ; and the latter therefore is the oldest writer
that I at present can mention as acquainted with this property.
He was a physician in Zealand, where madder has
been cultivated since the earliest ages, and where he had an
opportunity of remarking it. He says that the bones of animals
became red, as had been observed when the flesh was
dressed, by their eating only the leaves, and not the roots.
In the first edition of the above work, printed in octavo, in
the year 1559, which consists of two books, this information
will not be found; but it may be contained in the second of
1564, which comprehends four books.</p>

<p>[The madder plant is much cultivated in Holland, but
Macquei observes that the Dutch were first indebted to the
Flemish refugees for their knowledge of the method of preparing
this plant. Its culture has often been attempted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
England, but always without <span class="locked">success<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span>. It is also largely cultivated
in Alsace and Provence in France, especially near
Avignon, in Asiatic Turkey, and in Italy; from which places
it is largely exported. The Turkey and Provence madder is
procured from <i>Rubia peregrina</i>; the remainder from <i>R.
tinctorum</i>. To prepare the root, which is the part used in
dyeing, it is removed from the ground, picked, dried and
ground.</p>

<p>Madder contains three distinct colouring principles; two of
these are red, viz. alizarine and purpurine, and one, xanthine,
is yellow.</p>

<p>Since 1836, two new products have been introduced into
commerce, which are destined to replace madder in the operations
of dyeing and calico-printing; one is called garancine,
the other colorine. Garancine is prepared by washing and
macerating madder, and filtering through linen. The grounds
are then crushed and mixed with sulphuric acid, equal to
half the amount of madder first employed; the acid should
be somewhat dilute. It is then poured hot upon the madder,
agitated, and when the mixture appears intimate, the temperature
is raised to 212°, and maintained for about an hour.
It is then again mixed with water, filtered, and thoroughly
washed. It is finally pressed, dried and passed through the
sieve. This is the process patented by MM. Lagier, Robiquet
and Colin, in 1828.</p>

<p>It was first introduced into commerce by the house of
Lagier and Thomas, at Avignon, in 1829.</p>

<p>The great advantage of garancine over madder is that it
does not change the white, and that the bleaching of the stuffs
dyed with it is reduced to a mere nothing. Hot water or
bran are the only means used for clearing them. Madder is
an adjective colour, that is to say, one which requires to be
combined with some basic substance or mordant to render
its fixture upon the dye-stuff permanent.]</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_274" id="Footnote_274" href="#FNanchor_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> Some also may with equal propriety have called it <i>sandyx</i>; and I am
of opinion that under this name we are to understand our madder, at least
in a passage of Virgil, Eclogue iv. 45, where he says, “Sponte sua sandyx
pascentes vestiet agnos.” As the wool of the sheep became red by eating
the madder which grew in the fields, it could be immediately manufactured,
without dyeing it artificially. We manufacture the wool of our
brown sheep in its natural colour, and this was done also by the ancients.
Cloths of this kind were the <i>panni nativi coloris</i>, as they are called by
Pliny, xxxvi. 7; and the words of Martial, xiv. 133, allude to a dress
made of such cloth:

</div>

<p>
I shall here take occasion to remark, that the word <i>lutum</i>, in the line
preceding the above passage of Virgil, must be translated <i>yellow-weed</i>, and
not <i>woad</i>. The former, <i>Reseda luteola</i>, dyes yellow; but the latter, <i>Isatis</i>,
dyes blue. <i>Lutum</i>, however, in Cæsar De bello Gallico, v. 14, seems to have
been <i>woad</i>: “Omnes se Britanni luteo inficiunt, quod et cæruleum efficit
colorem.” It appears, therefore, that both names were liable to be confounded
in the Latin, as they are in the German; unless Davis be right,
who, instead of <i>luteo</i>, reads <i>vitro</i>. That <i>sandyx</i>, in Virgil, signifies a plant
rather than a mineral, is to me far more probable. The author speaks of
plants which the sheep ate while feeding (<i>pascentes</i>); and both the above-mentioned
dye-plants, yellow-weed and woad, grow wild in Italy. The
opinion of Pliny, who understood the passage so, is not to be despised;
and therefore the poetical account, that the pasture dyed the wool, is not
altogether without foundation; especially as not only the roots, but also
the leaves of madder, communicate a colour to the solid parts of animal
bodies. I will however allow that most people readily fall into the error
of being led away by imagination; and often suppose that they find in
passages of ancient authors more than others can discover, or perhaps
even than they contain.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_277" id="Footnote_277" href="#FNanchor_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> That the <i>Rubia</i> colours the milk has been denied by many, who are
mentioned in Haller’s Physiol. viii. p. 328. Young, in his Treatise De
Lacte, says only that it has no effect on carnivorous animals. Being once
engaged in making experiments on the madder dye, I gave the plant to a
cow for several days, and I found that the milk became reddish and streaked
with veins which were of a darker colour than the other parts. That well-known
farmer, Gugenmus, gave the madder-plant, formed into hay, to his
cows, who ate it readily. Their milk was somewhat reddish, and the
butter and cheese acquired by these means in winter an agreeable colour.
Perhaps the effects do not take place when the animals get other food at
the same time. Or may not the state of their health occasion some difference?
This much is certain, that <i>Chelidonium</i> (swallow-wort) makes
the milk of cows that are weak appear bloody, while the same effect does
not follow, or at least immediately, in those that are strong. Ruellius, De
Natura Stirpium, Basiliæ, 1543, fol. p. 572, says of the Rubia, “Folia capillum
tingunt.” If he meant that the hair became red by eating the
leaves, he committed a mistake.</p></div>

<h2 id="jugglers">JUGGLERS, ROPE-DANCERS, AUTOMATA, <span class="smcap smaller">ETC.</span></h2>

<p>Under this title I comprehend not only those properly called
jugglers, who, for the sake of money, by quick and artful
motions of their hands, bodies, and limbs, and by various
preparations, delude the senses in an agreeable manner, or
practise an innocent deception on the spectators, so that they
think they hear and see what they do not really hear and see,
but also rope-dancers; people who place their bodies in positions
according to all appearance dangerous; and those who
for pay exhibit animals taught to perform uncommon tricks,
as well as automata, which by their concealed construction
seem to produce wonderful effects.</p>

<p>But is it worth while to inquire into the antiquity of all
these arts, unprofitable to the public, which form the favourite
amusements of the populace? The selfish question <i>cui bono</i>,
which is often thrown out by way of reproach to men of letters,
but oftener to naturalists, and even to jurists, when, in
their researches, they advance beyond the beaten track, I
might easily get rid of by civilly telling the querists to pass
over this article if they think they are not likely to derive
benefit from it. I might also apologise for employing my
time and labour on this subject, by using the words of a certain
historian: “Frivola hæc fortassis cuipiam et nimis levia
esse videantur, sed curiositas nihil recusat.” I shall however
adopt neither of these methods; as I flatter myself that this
essay may afford as much amusement as many that are read
daily; and that therefore it may not only be excused, but
even justified.</p>

<p>Those arts and employments which are most necessary in
life were undoubtedly the earliest, and they have still continued
to be the most important; but when these were sufficiently
occupied, or carried on by as many persons as could
live by them, the rest, who were excluded from them, conceived
the idea of amusing the former when tired with their
labour, that by these means they might obtain from them a
part of the fruits of their industry. I request my readers to
reflect how many occupations have been devised for no other
purpose. They will find that several of these have acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
a pre-eminence over the necessary or useful arts; and to the
same class belong jugglers.</p>

<p>All political writers tell us, as a fundamental principle of
government, that population ought to be increased. This
maxim however is just only under certain circumstances;
that is, when employment can be procured to a greater number
of inhabitants than a country already possesses. Of beggars
we have to maintain too many. All our trades and occupations
are not only filled up with workmen, but overflow.
Our farmers can employ no more labourers, and our manufacturers
no more hands than they have at present; our regiments
are full; and in every employment there are more
candidates and more supernumeraries than is consistent with
the good of the public. Must it not therefore give us pleasure,
when necessity invents new means of acquiring a livelihood,
although they could be dispensed with? It is much
better that those who have learned no useful art; who have
lost their youth in the service of others; or who are destitute,
through any other cause, should gain their bread by amusing
their fellow-citizens, than that they should either beg or steal.</p>

<p>These arts are indeed not unprofitable, for they afford a
comfortable subsistence to those who practise them; but their
gain is acquired by too little labour to be hoarded up; and,
in general, these roving people spend on the spot the fruits
of their ingenuity; which is an additional reason why their
stay in a place should be encouraged. I have however known
some who saved so much from their earnings, that, in their
old age, they were enabled to enter into some business more
certain as well as more profitable.</p>

<p>People of this description will never want encouragement
and support while they exhibit with confidence anything uncommon,
and know how to suit the nature of their amusements
to the taste of the spectators. The greater part of
mankind love deception so much, that they reward liberally
those who impose on their senses, as is proved by the ready
sale of gilt articles, artificial gems, and a thousand other things
which are not in reality what they appear to be. I do not
know whether Montagne is right in considering it as a sign
of the weakness of our judgement, that we take a pleasure in
beholding objects on account of their rarity, novelty, or the
difficulty that attends them, though they may be subservient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to no useful <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></span>. This appears to me to proceed from
that innate curiosity which serves as a spur to incite us to
enlarge our knowledge, and to engage in researches and undertakings
that often lead to discoveries of greater importance.</p>

<p>Jugglers indeed seldom exhibit anything that can appear
wonderful to those acquainted with natural philosophy and
mathematics; but these even often find satisfaction in seeing
truths already known to them applied in a new manner; and
they readily embrace every opportunity of having them further
illustrated by experiments. Many however are too precipitate,
and attempt to explain before they have sufficiently
examined, of which the golden tooth at the end of the sixteenth
century, the conjuring-rod at the end of the seventeenth,
and the chess-player and speaking-machine at the end
of the eighteenth, may serve as instances. But it often happens,
that what ignorant persons first employ, merely as a
show, for amusement or deception, is afterwards ennobled by
being applied to a more important purpose. The machine
with which a Savoyard, by means of shadows, amused children
and the populace, was by Lieberkühn converted into a
solar microscope; and to give one example more, which may
convince female readers, if I can hope for such, the art of
making ice in summer, or in a heated oven, enables guests,
much to the credit of their hostess, to cool the most expensive
dishes. The Indian discovers precious stones, and the
European, by polishing, gives them a lustre.</p>

<p>But if the arts of juggling served no other end than to
amuse the most ignorant of our citizens, it is proper that they
should be encouraged for the sake of those who cannot enjoy
the more expensive deceptions of an opera. They answer
other purposes however than that of merely amusing; they
convey instruction in the most acceptable manner, and serve
as a most agreeable antidote to superstition, and to that popular
belief in miracles, exorcism, conjuration, sorcery, and
witchcraft, from which our ancestors suffered so severely.
Wherever the vulgar were astonished at the effects of shadows,
electricity, mirrors, and the magnet, interested persons
endeavoured by these to frighten them; and thus misapplied
the powers of nature to promote their own advantage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
pontiffs and their clergy ought, undoubtedly, to be detested
for discouraging experimental philosophy. That science they
considered as a formidable enemy; and they thought they
gained no small advantage when they induced the house of
Medici, by granting it the cardinalship, to suppress the Academy
del Cimento. When Gasner exhibited his deceptions,
some one proposed to him to try his art at Berlin or Göttingen,
and to drive out there if it were only the smallest of all
the devils; but these cities were not theatres where he was
likely to succeed, and he never ventured to appear in <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span>.
It is however better that the populace, if they will absolutely
pay for being deceived, should be exposed to a momentary
deception from jugglers than to a continual deception from
priests. As the former are not covered with the sacred cloak
of religion, their deceptions are more easily seen through and
detected; and they consequently soon cease to be hurtful.
So late as the year 1601, a horse, which had been taught
to perform a number of tricks, was tried, as possessed by the
devil, and condemned to be <span class="locked">burnt<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span>. At present horses of
this kind are so often exhibited publicly in the heretical
countries of Europe, that the Spanish Inquisition, perhaps,
will soon be ashamed of considering such proofs of the docility
of these animals, and of the patient dexterity of their
teachers, as the work of the devil, as they did at the above
period. Those who view the art of the juggler in the same
light as I do, will, I hope, forgive me for introducing these
observations, and allow me to continue them while I inquire
into the antiquity of this employment; especially as I shall
endeavour by these means to illustrate more fully my subject.</p>

<p>Had that book which Celsus wrote against the Magi been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
preserved, we should have been much better acquainted with
the art of the ancient conjurors or jugglers. This Celsus, without
doubt, is the same author whose virulent attack against
the Christians was refuted by Origen; and we have, therefore,
greater cause to regret that a work on the above subject, by so
learned and acute a philosopher, should have been lost. He is
mentioned with respect by Lucian, and even by Origen; and
the former derived from him the account which he gives of
Alexander the <span class="locked">impostor<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span>. More ancient authors also wrote
upon the same subject. Some of them are mentioned by Diogenes
Laërtius in his preface; and Suidas quotes the Magicon
of Antisthenes, though neither of these speaks of Celsus; but
of all those writings none are now extant.</p>

<p>The deception of breathing out flames, which at present
excites in a particular manner the astonishment of the ignorant,
is very ancient. When the slaves in Sicily, about a
century and a half before our æra, made a formidable insurrection,
and avenged themselves in a cruel manner for the
severities which they had suffered, there was amongst them
a Syrian named <span class="locked">Eunus<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span>, a man of great craft and courage,
who, having passed through many scenes of life, had become
acquainted with a variety of arts. He pretended to have immediate
communication with the gods; was the oracle and
leader of his fellow-slaves; and, as is usual on such occasions,
confirmed his divine mission by miracles. When, heated by
enthusiasm and desirous of inspiring his followers with courage,
he breathed flames or sparks among them from his
mouth while he was addressing them. We are told by historians,
that for this purpose he pierced a nut-shell at both ends,
and, having filled it with some burning substance, put it into
his mouth and breathed through it. This deception, at present,
is performed much better. The juggler rolls together
some flax or hemp, so as to form a ball about the size of a
walnut; sets it on fire; and suffers it to burn till it is nearly
consumed; he then rolls round it, while burning, some more
flax; and by these means the fire may be retained in it for a
long time. When he wishes to exhibit, he slips the ball unperceived
into his mouth and breathes through it; which
again revives the fire, so that a number of weak sparks proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
from it; and the performer sustains no hurt, provided he
inspire the air not through the mouth, but the <span class="locked">nostrils<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span>.</p>

<p>By this art the rabbi Bar-Cocheba, in the reign of the emperor
Hadrian, made the credulous Jews believe that he was
the hoped-for <span class="locked">Messias<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span>; and two centuries after, the emperor
Constantius was thrown into great terror, when Valentinian
informed him that he had seen one of the body-guards breathing
out fire and flames in the <span class="locked">evening<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span>.</p>

<p>For deceptions with fire the ancients employed also naphtha,
a liquid mineral oil, which kindles when it only approaches a
flame. Galen informs us, that a person excited great astonishment
by extinguishing a candle and again lighting it, without
any other process than holding it immediately against a wall
or a stone. The whole secret of this consisted in having previously
rubbed over the wall or stone with sulphur. But as
the author, a few lines before, speaks of a mixture of sulphur
and naphtha, there is reason to think that he alludes to the
same here. <span class="locked">Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> relates how Alexander the Great was
astonished and delighted with the secret effects of naphtha,
which were exhibited to him at Ecbatana. The same author,
as well as Pliny, Galen, and others, has already remarked,
that the substance with which Medea destroyed Creusa, the
daughter of Creon, was nothing else than this fine <span class="locked">oil<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span>. She
sent to the unfortunate princess a dress besmeared with it,
which burst into flames as soon as she approached the fire of
the altar. The blood of Nessus, wherein the dress of Hercules,
which took fire likewise, had been dipped, was undoubtedly
naphtha <span class="locked">also<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span>; and this oil must have been always
employed when offerings caught fire in an imperceptible <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span>.
In all periods of the world priests have acted as jugglers
to simple and ignorant people.</p>

<p>In modern times, persons who could walk over burning
coals or red-hot iron, or who could hold them in their hands
and their teeth, have often excited wonder. In the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the seventeenth century, an Englishman, named Richardson,
who, as we are assured, could chew burning coals, pour
melted lead upon his tongue, swallow melted glass, &amp;c.,
rendered himself very famous by these extraordinary <span class="locked">feats<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span>.
Laying aside the <span class="locked">deception<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span> practised on the spectators, the
whole of this secret consists in rendering the skin of the soles
of the feet and hands so callous and insensible, that the nerves
under them are secured from all hurt, in the same manner as
by shoes and gloves. Such callosity will be produced if the
skin is continually compressed, singed, pricked, or injured in
any other manner. Thus do the fingers of the industrious
sempstress become horny by being frequently pricked; and
the case is the same with the hands of fire-workers, and the
feet of those who walk bare-footed over scorching <span class="locked">sand<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
In the month of September, 1765, when I visited the copper-works
at Awestad, one of the workmen, for a little drink-money,
took some of the melted copper in his hand, and after
showing it to us, threw it against a <span class="locked">wall<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></span>. He then squeezed
the fingers of his horny hand close to each other; put it a
few minutes under his armpit, to make it sweat, as he said;
and, taking it again out, drew it over a ladle filled with melted
copper, some of which he skimmed off, and moved his hand
backwards and forwards, very quickly, by way of ostentation.
While I was viewing this performance, I remarked a smell
like that of singed horn or leather, though his hand was not
burnt. The workmen at the Swedish melting-houses showed
the same thing to some travellers in the seventeenth century;
for Regnard saw it in 1681, at the copper-works in Lapland.
It is highly probable that the people who hold in their hands
red-hot iron, or who walk upon it, as I saw done at Amsterdam,
but at a distance, make their skin callous before, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
like manner. This may be accomplished by frequently
moistening it with oil of vitriol; according to some the juice
of certain plants will produce the same effect; and we are
assured by others that the skin must be very frequently
rubbed, for a long time, with oil, by which means, indeed,
leather also will become horny.</p>

<p>Of this art, traces may be found also in the works of the
ancients. A festival was held annually on Mount Soracte,
in Etruria, at which the Hirpi, who lived not far from Rome,
jumped through burning coals; and on this account they
were indulged with peculiar privileges by the Roman <span class="locked">senate<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span>.
Women also, we are told, were accustomed to walk over
burning coals at Castabala in Cappadocia, near the temple
dedicated to <span class="locked">Diana<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span>. Servius remarks, from a work of Varro
now lost, that the Hirpi trusted not so much to their own
sanctity as to the care which they had taken to prepare their
feet for that operation.</p>

<p>I am not acquainted with everything that concerns the
trial by ordeal, when persons accused were obliged to prove
their innocence by holding in their hands red-hot iron; but
I am almost convinced that this also was a juggling trick of
the priests, which they employed as might best suit their
views. It is well known that this mode of exculpation was
allowed only to weak persons, who were unfit to wield arms,
and particularly to monks and ecclesiastics, to whom, for the
sake of their security, that by single combat was forbidden.
The trial itself took place in the church entirely under the
inspection of the clergy; mass was celebrated at the same
time; the defendant and the iron were consecrated by being
sprinkled with holy water; the clergy made the iron hot
themselves; and they used all these preparatives, as jugglers
do many motions, only to divert the attention of the spectators.
It was necessary that the accused persons should remain
at least three days and three nights under their immediate
care, and continue as long after. They covered their
hands both before and after the proof; sealed and unsealed
the covering: the former, as they pretended, to prevent the
hands from being prepared any how by art; and the latter to
see if they were burnt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Some artificial preparation was therefore known, else no
precautions would have been necessary. It is highly probable
that during the first three days the preventive was applied
to those persons whom they wished to appear innocent;
and that the three days after the trial were requisite to let
the hands resume their natural state. The sacred sealing
secured them from the examination of presumptuous unbelievers;
for to determine whether the hands were burnt, the
last three days were certainly not wanted. When the ordeal
was abolished, and this art rendered useless, the clergy no
longer kept it a secret. In the thirteenth century an account
of it was published by Albertus Magnus, a Dominican <span class="locked">monk<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span>.
If his receipt be genuine, it seems to have consisted rather in
covering the hands with a kind of paste than in hardening
them. The sap of the <i>Althæa</i> (marsh-mallow), the slimy
seeds of the flea-bane, which is still used for stiffening by the
hat-makers and silk-weavers, together with the white of an
egg, were employed to make the paste adhere; and by these
means the hands were as safe as if they had been secured by
gloves. The use of this juggling trick is very old, and may
be traced back to a pagan origin. In the Antigone of Sophocles,
the guards placed over the body of Polynices, which
had been carried away and buried contrary to the orders of
Creon, offered, in order to prove their innocence, to submit
to any trial: “We will,” said they, “take up red-hot iron in
our hands, or walk through <span class="locked">fire<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></span>.”</p>

<p>The exhibition of balls and cups, which is often mentioned
in the works of the ancients as the most common art of jugglers,
is also of great antiquity. It consists in conveying
speedily and with great dexterity, while the performer endeavours
by various motions and cant phrases to divert the
attention of the simple spectators from observing his movements
too narrowly, several light balls, according to the
pleasure of any person in company, under one or more cups;
removing them sometimes from the whole; and conveying
them again back in an imperceptible manner. In general,
three leaden cups are used, and as many balls of cork; and
to prevent all discovery by their slipping from the thumbs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the juggler, or making a noise, as he must lay hold of them
with much quickness, the table before which he sits is covered
with a cloth.</p>

<p>These small balls were by the ancients called <i>calculi</i>; and
the cups <i>acetabula</i>, or <i>paropsides</i>. <span class="locked">Casaubon<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span> has already
quoted most of those passages in ancient authors which relate
to this subject; and they have been repeated by <span class="locked">Bulenger<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span>;
but neither of these writers makes mention of the fullest and
clearest description given in the letters of <span class="locked">Alciphron<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span>. We
have there an account of a countryman who came to town,
and was conducted by a merchant to the theatre, where he
saw with great astonishment the exhibition of cups and balls.
“Such an animal,” says he, “as the performer I would not
wish to have near me in the country; for in his hands my
property would soon disappear.” The art of oratory, because
it deceives the auditors, is frequently compared to that of
balls and cups. From the Latin word <i>gabata</i>, mentioned by
Martial, together with <i>paropsides</i>, the French have made
<i>gobelets</i> and hence their common expressions <i>jouer des gobelets</i>,
and <i>joueur des gobelets</i>, which they use when speaking of
jugglers.</p>

<p>In all ages of the world there have been men who excited
great wonder by extraordinary strength. Instances of this
have been already collected; but they do not belong to my
present <span class="locked">subject<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span>. I can, however, prove that above fifteen
hundred years ago there were people who, by applying a
knowledge of the mechanical powers to their bodies, performed
feats which astonished every ignorant spectator;
though it is certain that any sound man of common strength
could perform the same by employing the like means. Of
these one may say with Celsus, “Neque hercule scientiam
præcipuam habent hi, sed audaciam usu ipso confirmatam.”</p>

<p>About the beginning of the last century, such a strong
man, or Samson, as he called himself, a native of Germany,
travelled over almost all Europe; and his pretended art has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
been mentioned by so many writers, that we may conclude it
had not been often exhibited before; and that it was then
considered as new. His name was John Charles von Eckeberg;
he was born at Harzgerode in Anhalt; and at that
time was thirty-three years of age. When he fixed himself
between a couple of posts, on any level place, two or more
horses were not able to draw him from his position; he could
break ropes asunder, and lift a man up on his knee while he
lay extended on the ground. But what excited the greatest
astonishment was, that he suffered large stones to be broke
on his breast with a hammer, or a smith to forge iron on an
anvil placed above it.</p>

<p>This last feat was exhibited even in the third century, by
Firmus or Firmius, who, in the time of Aurelian, endeavoured
to make himself emperor in Egypt. He was a native of Seleucia
in Syria; espoused the cause of Zenobia, the celebrated
queen of Palmyra; and was at length executed publicly by
order of the emperor Aurelian. It is of this Firmus, and not
of another, who a century after was overcome in Africa by
the father of the emperor Theodosius, that Vopiscus speaks
where he relates that he could suffer iron to be forged on an
anvil placed on his breast. For this purpose he lay on his
back; but he put himself in such a position, by resting with
his feet and shoulders against some support, that his whole
body formed an arch; so that he seemed rather to be suspended
than to lie at full <span class="locked">length<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span>. This art, which is explained
and illustrated by <span class="locked">Desaguliers<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span> and Professor <span class="locked">Kuhn<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span>
of Dantzic, has now become so common that it is often exhibited
without occasioning much surprise.</p>

<p>In the works of the ancients, rope-dancers are frequently
mentioned. The passages where they occur have been collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
by various authors, though never completely; and I
am inclined to think that those who have seen many performers
of this kind would be able to clear up some that are
obscure. I have seen many myself; but I have forgot the
greater part of what I observed; and there are other reasons
also which prevent me from undertaking that task: I dread
the reproach of “multum agendo nihil agis.” That I may
not, however, pass over this subject entirely, I shall present
the reader with what <span class="locked">follows<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span>. We meet with various appellations
given to rope-dancers, which do not, as some have
imagined, point out different kinds, but allude only to new-invented
arts, leaps, or dexterities, which, while recommended
by novelty, were much wondered at, though they were afterwards
imitated by all. To these belong the <i>schœnobatæ</i>, <i>oribatæ</i>,
<i>neurobatæ</i>, <i>petaminarii</i>, <i>funambuli</i>, &amp;c. Some of the
ancient rope-dancers seem to have used a balancing-pole, or
at least to have had weights in their hands to preserve an
<span class="locked">equipoise<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span>. It is certain also that rope-dancers were not
wanting in the middle ages. In the year 1237 they were
very common in <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span>; and in 1393 there were some of them
at Augsburg, who exhibited their dexterity on the rope, and
received from each spectator three German <span class="locked">halfpence<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span>.</p>

<p>To place men upon the shoulders of each other in such a
manner that every row consists of a man fewer, till they form
a pyramid ending in a single person, upon whose head a boy
often stands with his feet upwards, is likewise an ancient
piece of dexterity. This exhibition is varied many ways;
and on that account it is difficult to form even conjectures
respecting it, especially as the description given of it by a
Roman poet is very <span class="locked">unintelligible<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
I am however still less acquainted with an art in which
hoops and wheels were employed by the <i>petauristæ</i>, who excited
great astonishment among the populace. The first part
of the art may have consisted in nothing more than the
varied contortions and tumbling which we still see practised
by children trained for that purpose. Cilano explains a
well-known passage of Manilius, as if the performers had
darted through suspended iron hoops, made often red-hot.
Of this I entertain less doubt than how we ought to understand
the <i>corpora jactata petauro</i> of <span class="locked">Juvenal<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span>; and the <i>corpora
valido excussa petauro</i> of <span class="locked">Manilius<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></span>, which many have
attempted to explain already. At any rate this wheel was
different from that upon which a female dancer, as mentioned
by Xenophon, wrote and read while it turned round with
great <span class="locked">velocity<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span>.</p>

<p>The art of exhibiting various feats of horsemanship, which
has been practised so much in modern times, seems to have
come first from the East. At any rate, those performers in
that way who, in the thirteenth century, were at the Byzantine
court, and who travelled all over Europe, came from Egypt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
They could stand on the horses when at a gallop; mount and
dismount while on full speed at the chase; tumble on horseback,
and do many other things equally <span class="locked">extraordinary<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span>. At
the end of the sixteenth century, an Italian, who had learned
this art while a slave in Turkey, went about exhibiting his
dexterity in various parts of Europe. Montagne saw him at
Rome in <span class="locked">1581<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></span>; and the year following he was at <span class="locked">Paris<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></span>.
Some of these feats were performed by the ancient <i>desultores</i>.</p>

<p>Whether the ancients taught horses, dogs, birds, and other
animals, to perform various tricks which are frequently exhibited
at present for money, I do not know; but it is certain
that what they made the elephant, which undoubtedly is the
most sagacious and tractable of all animals, perform, exceeds
everything yet known of the kind. Without repeating what
has been so often related, I shall only mention the elephant
which walked upon a rope backwards and forwards, as well
as up and down; and which Galba first caused to be shown
to the Roman people. After this, so much confidence was
placed in the dexterity of the animal, that a person sat on an
elephant’s back while he walked across the theatre upon a
rope extended from the one side to the other. Lipsius, who
has collected the testimonies, thinks they are so strong that
they cannot be <span class="locked">doubted<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span>.</p>

<p>The training of horses to obey a private signal, imperceptible
to the most attentive spectator, and to perform actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
which appear, to those unacquainted with the art, to display
rational faculties, I have never found mentioned in the works
of the ancients. That the Sybarites however taught their
horses to dance to the sound of music, is asserted by a variety
of <span class="locked">authors<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span>. In the sixteenth century, dogs trained in the
like manner excited great <span class="locked">wonder<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1766, an Englishman, named Wildman, made
himself much known by taming or training bees, in such a
manner that they not only followed him wherever he went,
but settled even on his face and hands without stinging him,
and seemed as if obedient to his <span class="locked">orders<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></span>. Some years after,
a person who practised the like art, travelled about through
Germany, and gave himself out to be Wildman; but M.
Riem proved that he was not Wildman, and published the
secret by which he acquired so much power over these <span class="locked">insects<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span>.
I cannot say whether the ancients were acquainted
with this art; but I shall here remark, that it was known in
the kingdom of Galam, at Senegal, a hundred years before
Wildman; for when Brue, a Frenchman, was there in 1698,
he was visited by a man who called himself the king of the
<span class="locked">bees<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span>. “Let his secret,” says that traveller, “consist in what
it may, this much is certain; that they followed him wherever
he went, as sheep do their shepherd. His whole body,
and particularly his cap, was so covered with them that they
appeared like a swarm just settled. When he departed they
went along with him; for besides those on his body, he was
surrounded by thousands which always attended <span class="locked">him<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
In modern times, persons destitute of arms and hands, or
who have these limbs formed very imperfectly, but who possess
the art of supplying that want by the use of their feet
and toes, show themselves sometimes for money; and as they
entertain the spectators by exciting their wonder, they deserve
from them that support which they are not able to
obtain in any other manner. Instances of such people who
had acquired this art, have been very common within the last
two <span class="locked">centuries<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span>; but in the works of the ancients I have
found only one. An Indian king, named Porus, sent to the
emperor Augustus an embassy with presents, among which
were some rare animals, and a man without arms, who with
his feet, however, could bend a bow; discharge arrows; and
put a trumpet to his mouth and blow it. Dio Cassius confesses
that he did not know how this was possible; but Strabo
refers for his authority to Nicolaus of Damascus, who saw all
the presents as they passed through <span class="locked">Antioch<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></span>. Had this deformed
person, whom Strabo compares to a Hermes, travelled
about, according to the modern practice, as a show,
he would have been better known, and in all probability his
example would have induced others to imitate his <span class="locked">art<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span>. Manilius
says, however, that there were people, who, in playing
at ball, could use their feet with as much dexterity as their
hands, who could catch the ball with them, and again throw
it back; but the poet, perhaps, did not allude to the small
hand-ball, but to the large one which is struck with the fist,
and which may be stopped also by the foot. Besides, the
passage is read and explained different <span class="locked">ways<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Figures or puppets, which appear to move of themselves,
were employed formerly to work miracles; but they could
hardly be used for that purpose at present in any catholic
country of Europe, though they still serve to amuse the vulgar.
Among these are the <i>marionettes</i><a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>, as they are called,
the different parts of which are put in motion imperceptibly
by a thread. Of a still more ingenious construction are those
which are moved by the turning of a cylinder, as is the case
in the machines with which some of the old miners in Germany
earn a livelihood; but the most ingenious of all are
those which are kept in continual movement for a certain
time, by the help of wheels with a weight or spring. The
latter are called <i>automata</i>; and, when they represent human
figures, <i>androides</i>. Under the former general name are comprehended
our watches, the most useful of all, and also <span class="locked">jacks<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span>,
with many others. The latter appellation is given to small
puppets, which, when their inner works have been wound up,
run upon the table or pavement, and as they advance move
their head, eyes, and hands. They have been exhibited
sometimes under the name of <i>courrante Margarethe</i>, which
gave rise perhaps to the word <i>marionette</i>.</p>

<p>The proper <i>marionettes</i> are very old. They were common
among the Greeks, and from them they were brought to the
Romans. They were known by the name of <i>neurospasta</i>,
and were much used at their shows. Aristotle speaks of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
which moved their head, eyes, hands and limbs in a very natural
<span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span>. They are mentioned with equal precision by
Galen, Xenophon, Antoninus, Horace, Gellius, and others.
To these belong the <i>phalli</i>, which were carried round during
the festivals of Osiris and Bacchus, and of which one member
only, that properly meant by the name, and which was almost
as large as the whole body, moved upon certain threads
being <span class="locked">pulled<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></span>. Count Caylus has given an engraving of the
body of a small puppet, made of ivory or bone; but he requires
too much when he desires us to consider that fragment,
merely on his word, as a piece of Greek or Roman antiquity.
He at least ought to have informed us where it was found,
and by what means he procured it. In regard to such articles,
it is as easy to deceive as to be led into an error; and objects
of bone are certainly of no great <span class="locked">duration<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></span>.</p>

<p>The question concerning the antiquity of automata, properly
so called, which are moved by wheels, weights and
springs, I shall leave to those who have read the works of the
ancient mathematicians, and who may be desirous of writing
on the history of mechanics. As far as I know, the ancients
were not acquainted with the art of making them, unless
some propositions of Ctesibius, mentioned by Vitruvius,
allude to that subject. When clocks were brought to perfection,
some artists added to them figures, which at the time
of striking performed various movements; and as they succeeded
in these, some attempted to make, detached from
clocks, single figures, which either moved certain limbs, or
advanced forward and ran. In the middle of the sixteenth
century, when Hans <span class="locked">Bullmann<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span>, a padlock-maker at Nuremberg,
constructed figures of men and women which moved
backwards and forwards by clock-work, beat a drum, and
played on the lute according to musical time, they excited
universal astonishment as a new invention. It was about
the same period that watches came into use. The accounts
however which speak of much older automata deserve to be
examined with more attention.</p>

<p>The most ancient of all are undoubtedly the tripods constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
by <span class="locked">Vulcan<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span>, which being furnished with wheels, advanced
forwards to be used, and again returned to their places.
But what was impossible to the gods of Homer? An unbeliever
might conjecture that these tripods, which are mentioned
also by <span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span>, and which perhaps were only a kind
of small tables or dumb-waiters, had wheels so contrived that
they could be put in motion and driven to a distance on the
smallest impulse, like the fire-pans in our country beer-houses,
at which the boors light their pipes.</p>

<p>That Dædalus made statues which could not only walk,
but which it was necessary to tie, in order that they might
not move, is related by <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span>, Aristotle, and others. The
latter speaks of a wooden Venus, and remarks that the secret
of its motion consisted in quicksilver having been poured into
it. What the author here means I cannot comprehend; but
I do not imagine that this Venus threw itself topsy-turvy
backwards, like the Chinese puppets. However this may be,
it is astonishing that the Chinese should have fallen upon the
invention of giving motion to puppets by means of quicksilver,
and in so ingenious a manner, that <span class="locked">Muschenbroek<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span>
thought it worth his while to describe their whole construction,
and to illustrate it by figures. But before this method
was known in Europe, Kircher had an idea of putting a small
waggon in motion by adding to it a pipe filled with quicksilver,
and heating it with a candle placed below <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></span>. The
account of Aristotle is more mysterious, for he does not inform
us how the quicksilver acted.</p>

<p>Callistratus, another writer, who was the tutor of Demosthenes,
gives us to understand that the statues of Dædalus
were made to move by the mechanical <span class="locked">powers<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></span>. But what
has been asserted by Palæphatus, and by <span class="locked">Gedoyn<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span>, Banier,
Goguet, and others among the moderns, is most probable.
The first statues of the Greeks were imitations of those of the
Egyptians, for the most part clumsy figures, with their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
shut, their arms hanging down close to the body on each
side, and their feet joined together. Those made by Dædalus
had their eyes open, as well as their feet and hands free; and
the artist gave them such a posture, that they seemed either
reclining, or appeared as if ready to walk or to run. As
<span class="locked">Anacreon<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span>, struck with wonder, exclaimed when he saw a
waxen image of his favourite object, “Begone, wax, thou wilt
soon speak!” the astonished Greeks in like manner cried out,
when they beheld the statues of Dædalus, “They will soon
walk.” The next generation affirmed that they really walked;
and their posterity, adding still to what was told them, asserted
that they would have run had they not been bound.</p>

<p>Equally imperfect is the account given of the wooden
pigeon constructed by Archytas of Tarentum. We are informed
that it flew; but when it had once settled, it could
not again take flight. The latter is not incredible; but even
if we allow that aërostatic machines were then known, it is
impossible to believe the former. At present one cannot determine
with any probability, what piece of mechanism gave
rise to this <span class="locked">relation<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></span>. The head of Albertus Magnus, which
is said not only to have moved, but to have spoken, is too
little known for any opinion to be formed concerning it. The
construction of it must have been very ingenious and complex,
if it be true that he was employed upon it thirty <span class="locked">years<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth and following centuries, automata, as I
have said, were frequently made. Among these was the iron
fly of John Müller or Molitor, or, as he is sometimes called,
Regiomontanus, which is said to have flown about; and his
artificial eagle, which flew to meet the Emperor Maximilian
on his arrival at Nuremberg, June the 7th, 1470. None of the
contemporary writers, however, though they often speak of
this very learned man, make the least mention of these pieces
of mechanism; and it is probable that the whole tale originated
with Peter <span class="locked">Ramus<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></span>, who never was at Nuremberg till
the year 1571. J. W. <span class="locked">Baier<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></span> endeavours to prove that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
above-mentioned fly, moved by wheel-work, leaped about
upon a table; and that the eagle perched upon the town-gate,
stretched out its wings on the emperor’s approach, and saluted
him by an inclination of its body. We know that
Charles V., after his abdication, amused himself during the
latter period of his life with automata of various <span class="locked">kinds<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></span>.</p>

<p>The most ingenious, or at least the most celebrated automata,
were those made by Vaucanson, which he exhibited
publicly at Paris, for the first time, in 1738. One of them,
which represented a flute-player sitting, performed twelve
tunes, and, as we are assured, by wind issuing from its mouth
into a German-flute, the holes of which it opened and shut
with its fingers. The second was a standing figure, which
in the like manner played on the Provençal shepherd’s pipe,
held in its left hand, and with the right beat upon a drum or
<i>tambour de Basque</i>. The third was a duck, of the natural
size, which moved its wings, exhibited all the gestures of that
animal, quacked like a duck, drank water, ate corn, and then
after a little time let drop behind it something that resembled
the excrement of a <span class="locked">duck<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></span>. These pieces must have been
often imitated. I saw some of the like kind in the year 1764,
at the palace of Zarsko-Selo, near Petersburg, and was told
that they had been purchased from <span class="locked">Vaucanson<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></span>. As far as
I can remember, the tambourin was damaged. I saw there
also a regiment of soldiers, which went through their exercise,
moved by <span class="locked">wheel-work<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
In the year 1752, one Du Moulin, a silversmith, travelled
about through Germany with automata like those of Vaucanson.
In 1754, he wished to dispose of them to the margrave
of Bayreuth; but he was obliged to pawn them in
Nuremberg, at the house of Pfluger, who offered to sell them
for 3000 florins, the sum lent upon them. They were afterwards
purchased by counsellor Beireis, at Helmstadt, who
kindly showed them to me. It is much to be regretted that
the machinery of them is greatly deranged; the flute-player
emits only some very faint tones; but the duck eats, drinks,
and moves still. The ribs, which are of wire, had been covered
with duck’s feathers, so as to imitate nature; and as
these are now lost, one can see better the interior construction;
respecting which I shall only observe, that the motion
is communicated by means of a cylinder and fine chains, like
that of a watch, all proceeding through the feet of the duck,
which are of the usual size. <span class="locked">Nicolai<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></span> says that Du Moulin
came to Petersburg in 1755, and died at Moscow in 1765.
It is probable that he made the automata which I saw in
Russia. Those which he left behind him at Nuremberg seem
either not to have been completed, or to have been designedly
spoiled by him; for they appeared to have defects which
could not be ascribed to any accident. M. Beireis however
has begun to cause them to be repaired.</p>

<p>Of all these automata, the duck I confess appeared to me
the most ingenious; but I can prove that like pieces of mechanism
were made before the time of Vaucanson. We are
told by <span class="locked">Labat<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span>, that the French general De Gennes, who,
about the year 1688, defended the colony of St. Christopher
against the English, constructed a peacock which could walk
about, pick up from the ground corn thrown before it, digest
it, according to appearance, and afterwards drop something
that resembled excrement. This man was of an ancient
noble family in Brittany, which had however been so reduced,
that the father carried on a handicraft. The son became acquainted
with the marquis de Vivonne, who, on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
his promising talents, bred him to the sea. He rose to be
commander of a vessel, conducted a squadron to the Straits
of Magellan, where it was intended to form a colony, and
obtained in Cayenne a tract of land, which he got erected
into a county, under the name of Oyac. He invented machines
of various kinds useful in navigation and gunnery,
and, as we are told, constructed clocks that moved without
weights or springs.</p>

<p>The flute-player also of Vaucanson was not the first of its
kind. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the anonymous
author of that well-known poem Zodiacus Vitæ, saw at
Rome a figure made in the like manner by a potter. It is
much to be regretted that no account is given of its construction.</p>

<p>I shall here beg leave to say a few words respecting an
object of juggling, which, however old it may be, still excites
astonishment, and has often imposed upon the credulity of
men of <span class="locked">learning<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></span>: I mean those speaking machines, which,
according to appearance, answer various questions proposed
to them, sometimes in different languages, sing, and even
blow a huntsman’s horn. The figure, or only a head, is often
placed upon a box, the forepart of which, for the better deception,
is filled with a pair of bellows, a sounding-board,
cylinder, and pipes, supposed to represent the organs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
speech. At other times the machine is only like a peruke-maker’s
block, hung round with a Turkish dress, furnished
with a pair of arms, and placed before a table, and sometimes
the puppet stands upon the table, or against a wall. The
sounds are heard through a speaking-trumpet, which the
figure holds in its mouth.</p>

<p>Many jugglers are so impudent as to assert that the voice
does not proceed from a man, but is produced by machinery,
in the same manner as the music of an organ. Some, like
the last whom I saw, are more modest or timorous, and give
evasive answers to the questions asked them respecting the
cause of the voice, with as much art as those who exhibit
with balls and cups. Concerning these speaking machines,
however, different opinions are entertained. Some affirm
that the voice issues from the machine; others, that the juggler
answers himself, by speaking as ventriloquists do, or by
having the power to alter his voice; and some believe that
the answers are given by a man somewhere concealed. The
violence with which these opinions are maintained exposes
the juggler often to the danger of losing his life; for, when
the illusion is detected, the populace, who in part suffer themselves
willingly to be deceived, and who even pay the juggler
for his deception, imagine that they have a right to avenge
themselves for being imposed on. The machines are sometimes
broken; and the owners of them are harshly treated as
impostors. For my part, I do not see why a juggler, with a
speaking machine, is a more culpable impostor than he who
pretends to breathe out flames and to swallow boiling oil, or
to make puppets speak, as in the Chinese shadows. The
spectators pay for the pleasure which they receive from a
well-concealed deception, and with greater satisfaction the
more difficult it is for them to discover it. But the person
who speaks or sings through a puppet, is so well hid, that
people of considerable penetration have imagined that such
concealment was impossible. At present this art is well
known.</p>

<p>Either a child or a woman is concealed in the juggler’s
box; or some person, placed in a neighbouring apartment,
speaks into the end of a pipe which proceeds through the
wall to the puppet, and which conveys the answers to the
spectators. The juggler gives every necessary assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
to the person by signs previously agreed on. I was once
shown, in company with M. Stock, upon promising secrecy,
the assistant in another apartment, standing before the pipe,
with a card in his hand on which the signs were marked;
and he had been brought into the house so privately that the
landlady was ignorant of the circumstance. The juggler,
however, acknowledged that he did not exhibit without fear;
and that he would not venture to stay long at a place like
Göttingen, or to return with his Turks, though the populace
were so civil as to permit him to depart peaceably with what
he had gained.</p>

<p>The invention of causing statues to speak by this method
seems so simple, that one can scarcely help conjecturing that
it was employed in the earliest periods to support superstition;
and many have imagined that the greater part of the
oracles spoke in the same <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span>. This, however, is false,
as has been proved by the Jesuit Baltus, and the anonymous
author of a Reply to Fontenelle’s History of <span class="locked">Oracles<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></span>. It
appears that the pagan priests, like our jugglers, were afraid
that their deceptions, if long practised, might be discovered.
They considered it therefore as more secure to deliver the
answers themselves; or cause them to be delivered by women
instructed for that purpose, or by writing, or by any other
means. We read, nevertheless, that <span class="locked">idols<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></span> and the images of
saints once spoke; for at present the latter will not venture to
open their mouths. If their votaries ever really heard a voice
proceed from the statue, it may have been produced in the
before-mentioned manner.</p>

<p>Whether the head of Orpheus spoke in the island of
Lesbos, or, what is more probable, the answers were conveyed
to it by the priests, as was the case with the tripod at
Delphi, cannot with certainty be determined. That the impostor
Alexander, however, caused his Æsculapius to speak
in this manner, is expressly related by <span class="locked">Lucian<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></span>. He took,
says that author, instead of a pipe, the gullet of a crane, and
transmitted the voice through it to the mouth of the statue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
In the fourth century, when bishop Theophilus broke to pieces
the statues at Alexandria, he found some which were hollow,
and placed in such a manner against a wall that a priest could
slip unperceived behind them, and speak to the ignorant populace
through their <span class="locked">mouths<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></span>. I am acquainted with a passage
which seems to imply that Cassiodorus, who, it is well
known, constructed various pieces of mechanism, made also
speaking machines; but I must confess that I do not think I
understand the words <span class="locked">perfectly<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></span>.</p>

<p>That people ventured more than a hundred years ago to
exhibit speaking machines for money, has been proved by
Reitz in his annotations to Lucian, where he produces the
instance of one Thomas Irson, an Englishman, whom he himself
knew, and whose art excited much wonder in king
Charles II. and his whole court. When the astonishment,
however, became general, one of the pages discovered, in the
adjoining chamber, a popish priest who answered in the same
language, through a pipe, the questions proposed to the
wooden head by whispering into its ear. This deception
Irson often related <span class="locked">himself<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></span>.</p>

<p>I shall now add only a few observations respecting the
Chinese shadows, which I have occasionally mentioned before.
This ingenious amusement consists in moving, by pegs
fastened to them, small figures cut out of pasteboard, the
joints of which are all pliable, behind a piece of fine painted
gauze placed before an opening in a curtain, in such a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
as to exhibit various scenes, according to pleasure; while
the opening covered with gauze is illuminated, towards the
apartment where the spectators sit, by means of light reflected
back from a mirror; so that the shadows of the pegs
are concealed. When it is requisite to cause a figure to perform
a variety of movements, it is necessary to have several
persons, who must be exceedingly expert. When a snake is
to be represented gliding, the figure, which consists of delicate
rings, must be directed at least by three assistants.</p>

<p>This amusement, which one can hardly see the first time
without pleasure, is really a Chinese invention. Many years
ago, I have seen Chinese boxes on which such moveable
figures were apparent only when the box was held against the
light. In China, these shadows are used at the well-known
feast of lanterns; and a description of them may be found in
the works of some travellers. That they were common also
in Egypt, we are informed by Prosper <span class="locked">Alpinus<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></span>, who admired
them much; but he was not able to discover the method by
which they were produced, as it was kept a secret. I was
told by an Italian, who exhibited them at Göttingen some
years ago, that they were first imitated, from the Chinese, at
Bologna.</p>

metal, as suggested by Sir David Brewster, Nat. Magic, p. 301, which
consists of mercury, tin and bismuth, and which melts at a low temperature,
might easily have been substituted in place of lead; and fluids, the
boiling-point of which is lower than water, might easily have been substituted
for that liquid.

A solution of spermaceti in sulphuric æther, tinged with alkanet root,
which solidifies at 50° F., and melts and boils with the heat of the hand,
is supposed to be the substance which is used at Naples, when the dried

The experiments of M. Tillet, Dr. Fordyce and Sir Charles Blagden, will
show the great heat which may be endured by the human body. Some
of these gentlemen remained in a room where the heat was one or two
degrees above 260° F. for eight minutes; a beaf-steak was cooked in the
same atmosphere, and was overdone in thirty-three minutes; when the
steak was blown upon with a pair of bellows, it was found to be pretty
well done in thirteen minutes. But Sir F. Chantry exposed himself to a
still greater heat in the furnace used for drying his moulds. When raised
to its highest temperature, the thermometer indicated 350° F., and the
iron floor was red-hot. The workmen often entered it at 340°. On one occasion
Sir F., accompanied by five or six of his friends, entered the furnace,
and after remaining two minutes, they brought out a thermometer
which indicated 320°. Some of the party experienced sharp pains in the
tips of their ears, and in the septum of the nose, whilst others felt a
pain in their eyes.&mdash;Brewster, <i>l. c.</i>]</p></div>

and protecting articles of dress, &amp;c. from the effects of fire, has long
been known. But the art of practically applying it, is due to the ingenuity
of the Chevalier Aldini of Milan. His dress consisted of a strong
cloth covering which had been steeped in a solution of alum, for the body,
arms and legs; whilst the head-dress was a large cap enveloping the whole
head down to the neck, with holes for the nose, eyes and mouth; the covering
for the feet was composed of asbestos, or amianthus cloth. The stockings
and cap were single, but the gloves were double, to enable the fireman
to take burning or red-hot bodies into his hands. A metallic dress
was added to this, consisting of a cap, with a mask, leaving a space between
it and the asbestos cap; a cuirass; a piece of armour for the trunk
and thighs; a pair of boots of double wire-gauze; and an oval shield five
feet long by two and a half wide, made by stretching the wire-gauze over
a slender frame of iron. All these pieces were made of wire-gauze.
</p>
<p>
It was found, that when armed with this apparatus, a man could walk
upon hot iron, in the midst of high flames, keep his head over a pan of
flaming fire, &amp;c. for several minutes, and this in some cases where the heat
was so intense that bystanders were obliged to stand at the distance of
eight or ten yards. This was remarkably shown in 1829, in the yard of
the barracks of St. Jervais. Two towers were erected, two stories high,
and were surrounded with heaps of inflamed faggots and straw. One of
the firemen, with a child on his back, in a wicker basket covered with metallic
gauze, and having a cap of amiantheric cloth, rushed into a narrow
place, where the flames were raging eight yards high. The violence of the
fire was so great that he could not be seen, while a thick black smoke
spread around, throwing out a heat which was insupportable to the spectators.
The man remained so long invisible that serious doubts were entertained
of his safety. He at length, however, issued from the fiery gulf
uninjured.]</p></div>

τροχὸς τῶν κεραμεικῶν ἐφ’ οὗ ἔμελλε θαυμασιουργήσειν</span>. In the
old edition of J. Ribittus, this passage is thus translated: “Allata est saltatrici
orbis saltatorius, in quo admiranda erat editura.” The first question
that arises is, what was <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τροχὸς τῶν κεραμεικῶν</span>. The last word
alluded to a place at Athens where wrestling was exhibited every year;
and on that account Aristophanes uses the expression <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πληγαὶ κεραμεικαί</span>.
This however affords no explanation. Bulenger, who quotes the same
passage, translates it in the following manner: “Illata est saltatrici figularis
rota, per quam se trajiceret, et miracula patraret.” He means here
therefore a potter’s wheel, the invention of Anacharsis, but that was always
called <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κεραμικὸς τροχὸς</span>, and not <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τροχὸς τῶν κεραμεικῶν</span>. But
even allowing that a potter’s wheel is meant, it is wrong to add <i>per quam
se trajiceret</i>; for the potter’s wheel is not like a hoop, but like a plate or
dish; and when turned round revolves not vertically, but horizontally.
Besides, how the performer could write or read on a wheel that she
jumped through, he has not thought proper to explain. “Scribere et
legere in rota dum versatur, mirabile quiddam est.” If a potter’s wheel
be meant, I consider it as certainly possible for a person to stand upon it
whilst it revolves with the greatest velocity, and even to read or write;
but it would be necessary to lift up the legs, in turn, with the utmost
quickness.</p></div>

it consisted entirely of wheels; that it was kept in motion by a heavy
piece of iron, as clocks are by a weight, and that when wound up in the
like manner, it turned the meat for a whole hour. He had before seen,
in some other place, another driven by smoke.&mdash;Reise, i. pp. 155, 249.
The latter kind seem to be somewhat older. Scappi, cook to pope Pius
V., gave a figure of one in his book Opera di M. Bartolomeo Scappi,
printed at Venice 1570, which is exceedingly scarce. I lately saw a copy,
which, instead of eighteen, had twenty-four engravings. It was printed
twice afterwards at the same place, viz. in 1571 and 1605, in quarto. The
third edition says, “con due aggiunte, cio é il Trinciante et il Maestro di
casa.” Bayle seems to confound this book with that of Platina De Honesta
Voluptate, or to think that the latter was the real author of it. This
however cannot be, as there were more than a hundred years between
the periods when Scappi and Platina lived. Platina died in 1481, and
not in 1581, as we read in Bayle.</p></div>

<h2 id="artificial">ARTIFICIAL ICE. COOLING LIQUORS.</h2>

<p>The art of preserving snow for cooling liquors during the
summer, in warm countries, was known in the earliest ages.
This practice is mentioned by <span class="locked">Solomon<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></span>, and proofs of it are
so numerous in the works of the Greeks and the Romans,
that it is unnecessary for me to quote them, especially as they
have been collected by <span class="locked">others<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></span>. How the repositories for
keeping it were constructed, we are not expressly told; but
what I know on the subject I shall here lay before the
reader.</p>

<p>That the snow was preserved in pits or trenches, is asserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
by <span class="locked">many<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></span>. When Alexander the Great besieged the city of
Petra, he caused thirty trenches to be dug and filled with
snow, which was covered with oak branches, and which kept
in that manner for a long <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></span>. Plutarch says that a covering
of chaff and coarse cloth is <span class="locked">sufficient<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></span>; and at present
a like method is pursued in Portugal. Where the snow has
been collected in a deep gulf, some grass or green sods, covered
with dung from the sheep-pens, is thrown over it; and under
these it is so well preserved, that the whole summer through
it is sent the distance of sixty Spanish miles to <span class="locked">Lisbon<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></span>.</p>

<p>When the ancients therefore wished to have cooling liquors,
they either drank the melted snow or put some of it
in their wine, or they placed jars filled with wine in the snow,
and suffered it to cool there as long as they thought proper.
It appears that in these trenches it could not remain long
clean; on the contrary, it was generally so full of chaff, that
the snow-water was somewhat coloured with it, and had a
taste of it, and for this reason it was necessary to strain either
it or the wine that had been cooled by <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></span>.</p>

<p>That ice also was preserved for the like purpose, is probable
from the testimony of various <span class="locked">authors<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></span>; but it appears
not to have been used so much in warm countries as in the
northern. Even at present snow is employed in Italy, Spain,
and Portugal; but in Persia, <span class="locked">ice<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></span>. I have never anywhere
found an account of Grecian or Roman ice-houses. By the
writers on agriculture they are not mentioned.</p>

<p>Mankind however soon conceived the idea of cooling water
without snow or ice, from having remarked that it became
cold more speedily when it had been previously boiled, or at
least warmed, and then put in a vessel among snow, or in a
place much exposed to the air. Pliny seems to give this as
an invention of <span class="locked">Nero<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></span>; and a jocular expression in <span class="locked">Suetonius<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
makes it at any rate probable that he was fond of water
cooled by this method; but it appears to be much older. It
seems to have been known even to Hippocrates: at least
<span class="locked">Galen<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></span> believes so. And <span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></span> was undoubtedly acquainted
with it; for he says that some were accustomed,
when they wished water to become soon cold, to place it first
in the sun and suffer it to grow warm. He relates also that,
the fishermen near the Black Sea poured boiling water over
the reeds which they used in fishing on the ice to cause them
to freeze sooner. <span class="locked">Galen<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></span> on this subject is still more precise.
He informs us that the above practice was not so much used
in Italy and Greece, where snow could be procured, as in
Egypt and other warm countries, where neither snow nor
cool springs were to be found. The water after it had been
boiled was put into earthen vessels or jars, and exposed in
the evening on the upper part of the house to the night air.
In the morning these vessels were put into the earth (perhaps
in a pit), moistened on the outside with water, and then
bound round with fresh or green plants, by which means the
water could be preserved cool throughout the whole day.
Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a>, who gives a like account from a book of Protagorides,
remarks, that the pitchers filled with water, which
had become warm by standing all day long in the sun, were
kept continually wet during the night, by servants destined
to that office, and in the morning were bound round with
straw. In the island of <span class="locked">Cimolus<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></span>, water which had become
warm in the day-time was put into earthen jars, and deposited
in a cool cellar, where it grew as cold as snow. It was generally
believed therefore, that water which had been warmed
or boiled, was soonest cooled, as well as acquired a greater
degree of refrigeration; and on this account boiled water is
mentioned so often in the works of the <span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></span>.</p>

<p>The same opinion prevails at present in the southern countries
of Asia, and people there still let their water boil before
they expose it to the air to <span class="locked">cool<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></span>. The experiments however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
which have been made on this subject by philosophers, have
proved very different in the result. When one indeed places
boiling and cold water, all other circumstances being equal,
in frosty air, the latter will become ice before the former has
cooled; but when one exposes to the cold, water that has
been boiled, and unboiled water of equal temperatures, the
former will be converted into ice somewhat sooner.</p>

<p>The experiments made by <span class="locked">Mariotte<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></span>, <span class="locked">Perrault<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></span>, the Academy
del <span class="locked">Cimento<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></span>, <span class="locked">Marian<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></span> and others, showed no perceptible
difference in the time of freezing, between boiled and
unboiled water; but the former produced ice harder and
clearer, the latter ice more full of blisters. In later times,
Dr. Black of Edinburgh has, from his experiments, asserted
the contrary. Boiled water, he says, becomes ice sooner than
unboiled, if the latter be left at perfect rest; but if the latter
be stirred sometimes with a chocolate stick, it is converted
into ice as soon as the former. This difference he explains
in the following manner:&mdash;Some motion promotes congelation;
this arises in the boiled water through its re-imbibing
air; and therefore it must necessarily freeze before the unboiled,
provided the latter be kept at perfect rest. Fahrenheit
had before remarked that water not moved, would show
a cold several degrees below the freezing-point, without becoming
<span class="locked">ice<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></span>.</p>

<p>M. Lichtenberg, with whom I conversed on these contradictory
results, assured me that he was not surprised at this
difference in the experiments. The time of congelation is
regulated by circumstances, with which philosophers are not
yet sufficiently acquainted. A certain, but not every degree
of stirring hastens it; so that every icy particle which is
formed on the side of the vessel, or which falls from the atmosphere,
may convert the water sufficiently cooled into ice
instantaneously; and such unavoidable accidents must, where
all other circumstances are equal, cause a great difference in
the period of freezing.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the cooling of water, in ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
times, of which I have already spoken, is not to be ascribed
so much to the boiling as to the jars being kept continually
wet, and to the air to which it was exposed. A false opinion
seems therefore to have prevailed respecting the cause; and
because it was considered to be the boiling, many have not
mentioned the real cause, which appeared to them only to
afford a trifling assistance, though it has been remarked both
by Galen and Athenæus. We know at present that coolness
is produced by evaporation. A thermometer kept wet in the
open air falls as long as evaporation <span class="locked">continues<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></span>. With sulphuric
æther, and still better with that of nitre, which evaporates
very rapidly, water may be made to freeze even in
the middle of summer; and Cavallo saw in summer a Fahrenheit’s
thermometer, which stood at 64°, fall in two minutes,
by means of æther, to +3, that is to 29° below the <span class="locked">freezing-point<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></span>.</p>

<p>On this principle depends the art of making ice at Calcutta
and other parts of India, between 25° 30′ and 23° 30′ of north
latitude, where natural ice is never seen unless imported.
Trenches two feet deep, dug in an open plain, are strewed
over with dry straw; and in these are placed small shallow
unglazed earthen pans, filled with water at sunset. The ice
which is produced in them is carried away before sunrise
next morning, and conveyed to an ice-cellar fifteen feet deep;
where it is carefully covered with straw to be preserved from
the external heat and air. A great deal, in this process, depends
upon the state of the atmosphere. When calm, pure
and serene, it is most favourable to the congelation; but
when the winds are variable, or the weather heavy and cloudy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
no ice is formed; and the same is often the case when the
nights are raw and <span class="locked">cold<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></span>.</p>

<p>It was once believed that this freezing was occasioned principally
by the water having been boiled; but it seems to be
owing much rather to <span class="locked">evaporation<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></span>. It is not however said
that the vessels are kept continually wet on the outside, but
that they are unglazed, and so porous or little burnt, that the
water oozes through them; and on that account their exterior
surface appears always <span class="locked">moist<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></span>. By vessels of this kind
the trouble of wetting is saved. What has been said respecting
the influence of the weather serves, in some measure, to
confirm my conjecture. The more it favours evaporation,
the ice is not only formed more easily, but it is better; and
when evaporation is prevented by the wind or the weather,
no ice is produced. The latest accounts how ice is made at
Benares, say expressly that boiled water is not employed;
and that all those vessels, the pores of which are stopped by
having been used, do not yield ice so soon or so good. In
porcelain vessels none is produced; and this is the case also
when the straw is <span class="locked">wet<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></span>.</p>

<p>Another method of cooling water also seems to have been
known to Plutarch. It consisted in throwing into it small
pebbles or plates of <span class="locked">lead<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></span>. The author refers to the testimony
of Aristotle; but this circumstance I cannot find in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the works of that philosopher which have been preserved.
It seems to be too unintelligible to admit of any opinion
being formed upon it; and the explanation given by Plutarch
conveys still less information than the proposition itself.
This is the case, in general, with almost all the propositions
of the ancients. We indeed learn from the questions that
they were acquainted with many phænomena; but the answers
scarcely ever repay the trouble which one must employ
in order to understand them. They seldom contain any further
illustration; and never a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>It appears that the practice of cooling liquors, at the tables
of the great, was not usual in any country besides Italy and
the neighbouring states, before the end of the sixteenth century.
In the middle of that century there were no ice-cellars
in France; for when Bellon relates, in the Account of his
travels, in 1553, how snow and ice were preserved at Constantinople
throughout the whole summer, for the purpose of
cooling sherbet, he assures us that the like method might be
adopted by his countrymen; because he had found ice-cellars
in countries warmer than France. The word <i>glacière</i>
also is not to be met with in the older dictionaries; and it
does not occur even in that of Monet, printed in <span class="locked">1635<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></span>.
Champier, the physician who attended Francis I. when he had
a conference with the emperor Charles V. and pope Paul III.
at Nice, saw the Spaniards and Italians put snow, which they
caused to be brought from the neighbouring mountains, into
their wine in order to cool it. That practice, which excited
his astonishment, he declared to be unhealthful; and this
proves that in his time it had not been introduced at the
French <span class="locked">court<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></span>.</p>

<p>Grand d’Aussy quotes an anecdote, related by Brantome,
from which he forms the same conclusion. The dauphin,
son of Francis I., being accustomed to drink a great deal of
water at table, even when he was overheated, Donna Agnes
Beatrix Pacheco, one of the ladies of the court, by way of
precaution, sent to Portugal for earthen vessels, which would
render the water cooler and more healthful; and from which
all the water used at the court of Portugal was drunk. As
these vessels are still used in Spain and Portugal, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
wine is cooled also with snow, both methods might have been
followed in France. I have in my collection of curiosities,
fragments of these Portuguese vessels; they are made of red
bole; are not glazed, though they are smooth, and have a
faint gloss on the surface like the Etruscan vases. They
are so little burnt that one can easily break them with the
teeth; and the bits readily dissolve to a paste in the mouth.
If water be poured into such vessels, it penetrates their substance;
so that, when in the least stirred, many air-bubbles
are produced; and it at length oozes entirely through <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></span>.
The water that has stood in them acquires a taste which
many consider as agreeable; and it is probable that it proceeds
from the bark of the fir-tree, with which, as we read,
they are burnt. When the vessels are new, they perform
their service better; and they must then also have a more
pleasant smell. If they really render water cold, or retain it
cool, that effect, in my opinion, is to be ascribed to the evaporation.
Their similarity to those in which the Indians make
ice is very apparent.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century, under the reign
of Henry III., the use of snow must have been well known
at the French court, though it appears that it was considered
by the people as a mark of excessive and effeminate luxury.
In the witty and severe satire on the voluptuous life of that
sovereign and his favourites, known under the title of L’Isle
des <span class="locked">Hermaphrodites<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></span>, a work highly worthy of notice but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
which is exceedingly scarce, we find an order of the Hermaphrodites
that large quantities of ice and snow should everywhere
be preserved, in order that people might cool their
liquors with them, even though they might occasion extraordinary
maladies, which, it seems, were then apprehended.
In the description of an entertainment we are told that snow
and ice were placed upon the table before the king; and that
he threw some of them into his wine; for the art of cooling
it without weakening it was not then known. The same
method was practised even during the whole first quarter of
the seventeenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></span>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the above century this luxury must
have been very common in France. At that period there
were a great many who dealt in snow and ice; and this was
a free trade which every person might carry on. Government,
however, which could never extort from the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
money enough to supply the wants of an extravagant court,
farmed out, towards the end of the century, a monopoly of
these cooling wares. The farmers, therefore, raised the price
from time to time; but the consumption and revenue decreased
so much that it was not thought worth while to continue
the restriction; and the trade was again rendered free.
The price immediately fell; and was never raised afterwards
but by mild winters or hot summers.</p>

<p>The method of cooling liquors by placing them in water
in which saltpetre has been dissolved, could not be known to
the ancients, because they were unacquainted with that salt.
They might however, have produced the same coolness by
other salts which they knew, and which would have had a
better effect; but this, as far as I have been able to learn,
they never attempted. The above property of saltpetre was
first discovered in the first half of the sixteenth century; and
it was not remarked till a long period afterwards, that it belongs
to other salts also.</p>

<p>The Italians at any rate were the first people by whom it
was employed; and about the year 1550, all the water, as
well as the wine, drunk at the tables of the great and rich
families at Rome, was cooled in this manner. Blasius Villafranca,
a Spaniard, who practised physic in that capital, and
attended many of the nobility, published, in the before-mentioned
year, an account of it, in which he asserts, more than
once, that he was the first person who had made the discovery
publicly known. In his opinion it was occasioned by
the remark that salt water in summer was always cooler than
fresh water. According to his directions, which are illustrated
by a figure, the liquor must be put into a bottle or
globular vessel with a long neck, that it may be held with
more convenience; and this vessel must be immersed in
another wide one filled with cold water. Saltpetre must
then be thrown gradually into the water; and while it is dissolving,
the bottle must be driven round with a quick motion
on its axis, in one direction. Villafranca thinks that the
quantity of saltpetre should be equal to a fourth or fifth part
of the water; and he assures us, that when again crystallized,
it may be employed several times for the same use, though
this, before that period, had by many been denied. Whether
other salts would not produce the like effect, the author did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
not think of trying; but he attempts to explain this of saltpetre
from the principles of Aristotle; and he tells his noble
patrons what rules they should observe for the preservation
of their health, in regard to cooling liquors.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century this method of
cooling liquors was well known, though no mention is made
of it by Scappi, in his book on cookery. Marcus Antonius
Zimara, however, speaks of it in his <span class="locked">Problems<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></span>. I do not
know at what time this Appulian physician lived. In a list
of the professors of Padua, his name is to be found under the
year 1525, as <i>Explicator philosophiæ ordinariæ</i>; and because
another is named under the year 1532, we have reason to
conjecture that he died about that time. But in that case
the physician Villafranca would probably have been acquainted
with the Problemata of Zimara; and would not have
said that no one had spoken of this use of saltpetre before
him.</p>

<p>Levinus <span class="locked">Lemnius<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></span> also mentions the art of cooling wine by
this method so much, that the teeth can scarcely endure it.
We are informed by Bayle that the earliest edition of his
work, which has been often reprinted, was published at
Antwerp, in the year 1559, in octavo. It contains only the
first two books; but as the above account occurs in the second
book, it must be found in this edition.</p>

<p>Nicolaus Monardes, a Spanish physician, who died about
the year 1578, mentions this use of saltpetre likewise. It was
invented, as he says, by the galley-slaves; but he condemns
it as prejudicial to health. From some expressions which he
uses, I am inclined to think that he was not sufficiently acquainted
with it; and that he imagined that the salt itself
was put into the liquor. At a later period we find some account
of it in various books of receipts; such as that written
by Mizaldus in 1566, and which was printed for the first time
the year <span class="locked">following<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the Mineralogy of Aldrovandi, first printed in 1648,
this process is described after Villafranca; but where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
editor, Bartholomæus Ambrosianus, speaks of common salt,
he relates that it was usual in countries where fresh water
was scarce to make deep pits in the earth; to throw rock-salt
into them; and to place in them vessels filled with water,
in order that it might be cooled. This remark proves that the
latter salt was then employed for the same purpose; but it
has led the editor into a very gross error. He thinks he
can conclude from it, that the intention of potters, when they
mix common salt with their clay, is not only to render the
vessel more compact, but also to make it more cooling for
liquors. But the former only is true. The addition of salt
produces in clay, otherwise difficult to be fused, the faintest
commencement of vitrification; a cohesion by which the
vessel becomes so solid that it can contain fluids, even when
unglazed; but for this very reason it would be most improper
for cooling, which is promoted by the evaporation of
the water that oozes through.</p>

<p>The Jesuit Cabeus, who wrote a voluminous commentary
on the Meteorologica of Aristotle, which were printed at
Rome in 1646, assures us that with thirty-five pounds of
saltpetre one can not only cool a hundred pounds of water,
by quickly stirring it, but convert it also into solid ice; and
for the truth of this assertion he refers to an experiment
which he made. Bartholin says that for the above account
he can give him full <span class="locked">credit<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></span>; but the truth of it is denied by
Duhamel, who suspects that this Jesuit took the shooting
crystals of the salt to be <span class="locked">ice<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></span>.</p>

<p>Who first conceived the idea of mixing snow or ice with
saltpetre and other salts, which increases the cold so much,
that a vessel filled with water, placed in that mixture, is congealed
into a solid mass of ice that may be used on the table,
I cannot with certainty determine; but I shall mention the
earliest account of it that I have been able to find. Latinus
Tancredus, a physician and professor at Naples, whose book
De Fame et Siti was published in 1607, speaks of this experiment;
and assures us that the cold was so much strengthened
by saltpetre, that a glass filled with water, when quickly
moved in the above mixture, became solid <span class="locked">ice<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
In the year 1626, the well-known commentary on the works
of Avicenna, by Sanct. Sanctorius, was published at Venice.
The author in this work relates, that in the presence of many
spectators, he had converted wine into ice, not by a mixture
of snow and saltpetre, but of snow and common <span class="locked">salt<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></span>. When
the salt was equal to a third part of the snow, the cold was
three times as strong as when snow was used alone.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon, who died in 1626, says that a new method
had been found out of bringing snow and ice to such a degree
of cold, by means of saltpetre, as to make water freeze. This,
he tells us, can be done also with common salt; by which it
is probable he meant unpurified rock-salt; and, he adds, that
in warm countries, where snow was not to be found, people
made ice with saltpetre alone; but that he himself had never
tried the <span class="locked">experiment<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></span>. Boyle, who died in 1691, made experiments
with various kinds of salts; and he describes how,
by means of salt, a piece of ice may be frozen to another solid
<span class="locked">body<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></span>. Descartes says that in his time this was a well-known
phænomenon, but highly worthy of <span class="locked">attention<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></span>.</p>

<p>Since that period the art of making ice has been spoken of
in the writings of all philosophers where they treated on heat
and cold, and with many other experiments has been introduced
into various books of receipts. It was then employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
merely for <span class="locked">amusement<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></span>; and no one suspected that it would
ever form an important item of luxury. In the like manner
Fugger’s first bills of exchange were said to be useful only
for gambling, and gunpowder was called a trifling discovery.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the seventeenth century, drinking-cups
made of ice and iced fruit were first brought to the table;
but towards the end of that century it appears that the French
began to congeal in this manner all kinds of well-tasted juices,
which were served up as refreshments at the tables of the
great and <span class="locked">wealthy<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></span>. This was a grand invention for the art
of cookery; which became common among the German
cooks, both male and female, about the middle of the last
century; and since that time our confectioners sell single
glasses of iced articles at balls and in the theatres.</p>

<p>I am acquainted with no older information respecting this
invention than what is contained in Barclay’s Argenis, which
is, indeed, a romance; but the author’s account makes the
possibility of its being used so clear, that we may certainly
conclude it was then employed; especially as he mentions it
several times. Arsidas finds in the middle of summer, at the
table of Juba, fresh apples, one-half of which was encrusted
with transparent ice. A basin, made also of ice and filled
with wine, was handed to him; and he was informed that to
prepare all these things in summer was a new art. Snow was
preserved throughout the whole year in pits lined with straw.
Two cups made of copper were placed the one within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
other, so as to leave a small space between them, which was
filled with water; the cups were then put into a pail, amidst
a mixture of snow and unpurified salt coarsely pounded, and
the water in three hours was converted into a cup of solid
ice, as well-formed as if it had come from the hands of a
pewterer. In the like manner apples just pulled from the
tree were covered with a coat of ice.</p>

<p>The first edition of the Argenis was printed at Paris in 1621,
and in that year the author died at the age of thirty-nine.</p>

<p>After brandy, from being a medicine, came into general
use as a liquor at table, and was drunk in common by the
populace, the Italians, above all, endeavoured to render it
weaker and more pleasant by various mixtures; and by raising
its value to make it more respectable, and at the same time
more useful to people of the first rank. That their wares
might be distinguished with more certainty, they gave them
the name of <i>liquori</i>; and under that appellation sold them to
foreign nations. The French were the first who adopted the
use of these articles; particularly after the marriage of
Henry II., when duke of Orleans, with Catharine de Medici,
in the year 1533. This event brought to France great numbers
of Italians, who made the French acquainted with these
delicacies of their native country; and who taught them to
prepare and to use them. They were the first, therefore, who
made and sold the fine <i>liqueurs</i> at Paris; and in order to
serve those who could not bear heating liquors, or rather to
serve themselves by filling their pockets with money, their
successors in this business invented about the year 1630 or
1633 that beverage called <i>lemonade</i>, because the juice of
lemons or oranges was its chief component part. This liquor
soon came into high repute, as it not only served for cooling
and refreshing people during the sultry heats of summer, but
was even recommended by physicians against putrid diseases.</p>

<p>The <i>limonadiers</i>, or venders of lemonade, endeavoured to
increase the first property, which occasioned the far greatest
consumption, by the means of ice; and one of them, Procope
Couteaux, an Italian from Florence, about the year 1660,
conceived the happy idea of converting such beverage entirely
into ice, by a process which had been before employed
only by jugglers. The ready sale which he found for his invention
induced others to make articles of the like kind. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
example, therefore, was followed by Le Fevre and Foi; and
these three for some years enjoyed a monopoly of this new-fashioned
commodity. About the year 1676, liquors cooled
by, or changed into ice, must however have been the principal
things sold by the <i>limonadiers</i>; for being then formed
into a company, the following delicacies were mentioned in
the patent which they received on that occasion: “Eaux de
gelée et glaces de fruits et de fleurs, d’anis et de canelle, franchipanne,
d’aigre de cetre, du sorbec,” &amp;c. There were at
that time in Paris two hundred and fifty masters in this employment.
In 1690, when De la Quintiny wrote, iced liquors
were extremely <span class="locked">common<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></span>.</p>

<p>People, however, long imagined that such articles could be
used only during the hot months of summer. In the year
1750, Dubuisson, successor to the celebrated Procope, <i>au
café de la rue des Fossés de S. Germain des Près</i>, and author
of the Art du Déstillateur, began to keep ready prepared, the
whole year through, ices of every kind for the use of those
who were fond of them. At first they were little called for,
except in the dog-days; but some physicians recommended
them in certain disorders. Have the physicians then, by
their opinion, done most service to the venders of <i>liqueurs</i>
and to cooks, or the latter to the physicians? This would
make a fine subject for an inaugural dissertation. It is, however,
certain, for we are told so by Dubuisson himself, that
after two cures, in which ices had been of the greatest service,
the <i>more discerning</i> part of the public made use of them
in every season of the year. That this part of the public
might never lose their conceit, the venders of <i>liqueurs</i> always
employed their thoughts upon new inventions. Among the
latest is that of iced butter, which acquired its name on account
of some likeness to that substance. It was first known
at the Parisian coffee-house (<i>caveau</i>) in 1774. The Duke
de Chartres often went thither to enjoy a glass of iced liquor;
and the landlord, to his great satisfaction and surprise, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
one day presented him with his arms formed of eatable ice,
articles of a similar kind immediately became fashionable.</p>

<p>[Ice is now used extensively for a variety of œconomical
purposes, such as packing salmon, cooling liquors, &amp;c. Of
late years it has become a regular article of commerce. In
September 1833, a cargo of ice, shipped at Boston, was discharged
at Calcutta. It was sold at threepence per pound,
while the native ice fetched sixpence. It was packed in solid
masses, within chambers of double planking, with a layer of
refuse tan or bark between them. The quantity shipped was
180 tons, of which about 60 wasted on the voyage, and 20
on the passage up the river to Calcutta. Thousands of tons
are now annually shipped from Boston (United States) to
our East Indies, to the West Indian Archipelago, and to the
Continent of South America, and quite recently ‘The Wenham
Lake Ice Company’ have erected extensive ice-houses in
London and at Liverpool, and arranged for the transportation
to this country of thousands of tons of ice. One surprising
circumstance connected with the trade, is the fact that their
ice, though transported to this country in the heat of summer,
is scarcely reduced in bulk. The masses are so large
that they expose a very small surface to atmospheric action
in proportion to their weight, and therefore do not suffer from
exposure to it, as the smaller and thinner fragments do, which
are obtained in our own or other warmer climates. It appears,
also, that ice frozen upon very deep water, is more hard
and solid than ice of the same thickness obtained from shallow
water; and even when an equal surface is exposed, melts
more slowly. In this country, the collection of ice, even by
those largely engaged in the trade, is an occasional and fitful
undertaking; depending, both as to time and quantity, upon
the accidental occurrence of severe frost; and when the process
of collection is carried on, it is with very few artificial
aids. In America, on the other hand, this labour can be regularly
carried on through the whole winter; while the adjuncts
of machinery for cutting and storing, and of steam for
transporting it, are brought extensively into action.</p>

<p>The details connected with this trade, as carried on in
America, are so novel and so interesting, that we lay them
before our readers with the confident belief that the result of
our labours will prove attractive to them. Wenham Lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
whence a large proportion of the ice now imported to this country
is obtained, is eighteen miles from Boston, in the State of
Massachusets; it occupies a very elevated position, and lies
embosomed in hills of majestic height and bold rugged character.
The lake has no inlet whatever, but is fed solely by
the springs which issue from the rocks at its bottom, a depth
of 200 feet from its surface. The ice-house, which is capable
of storing 20,000 tons of ice, is built of wood, with double
walls, two feet apart, all around; the space between which is
filled with sawdust; thus interposing a medium, that is a
non-conductor of heat, between the ice and the external air;
the consequence of which is, that the ice is scarcely affected
by any condition or temperature of the external atmosphere,
and can be preserved without waste for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>The machinery employed for cutting the ice is very curious,
and was invented for that express purpose. It is worked
by men and horses in the following manner:&mdash;From the time
when the ice first forms, it is carefully kept free from snow
until it is thick enough to be cut; that process commences
when the ice is a foot thick. A surface of some two acres is
then selected, which at that thickness will furnish about 2000
tons, and a straight line is then drawn through its centre from
side to side each way. A small hand-plough is pushed along
one of these lines, until the groove is about three inches deep
and a quarter of an inch in width, when the ‘Marker’ is introduced.
This implement is drawn by two horses, and makes
two new grooves, parallel with the first, twenty-one inches
apart; the gauge remaining in the original groove. The
marker is then shifted to the outside groove, and makes two
more. Having drawn these lines over the whole surface in
one direction, the same process is repeated in a transverse
direction, marking all the ice out into squares of 21 inches. In
the meantime, the ‘Plough,’ drawn by a single horse, is following
in these grooves, cutting the ice to a depth of 6 inches.
One entire range of blocks is then sawn out, and the remainder
are split off toward the opening thus made with an iron bar.
This bar is shaped like a spade and of a wedge-like form.
When it is dropped into the groove, the block splits off; a
very slight blow being sufficient to produce that effect, especially
in very cold weather. The labour of ‘splitting’ is slight
or otherwise, according to the temperature of the atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
‘Platforms,’ or low tables of frame-work, are placed near the
opening made in the ice, with iron slides extending into the
water, and a man stands on each side of this slide, armed with
an ice-hook. With this hook the ice is caught and by a sudden
jerk thrown up the ‘slide’ on to the ‘platform.’ In a cold
day everything is speedily covered with ice by the freezing
of the water on the platforms, slides, &amp;c., and the enormous
blocks of ice, weighing some of them more than two cwt., are
hurled along these slippery surfaces, as if they were without
weight. Beside this platform, stands a ‘sled’ of the same
height, capable of containing about three tons; which, when
loaded, is drawn upon the ice to the front of the store-house,
where a large stationary platform of exactly the same height,
is ready to receive its load; which, as soon as discharged, is
hoisted block by block, into the house.</p>

<p>Forty men and twelve horses will cut and stow away 400
tons a day. In favourable weather 100 men are sometimes employed
at once. When a thaw or a fall of rain occurs, it entirely
unfits the ice for market, by rendering it opake and porous; and
occasionally snow is immediately followed by rain, and that
again by frost, forming snow-ice, which is valueless, and must
be removed by the ‘plane.’ The operation of ‘planing’ is somewhat
similar to that of ‘cutting.’ A plane gauged to run in the
grooves made by the ‘marker,’ and which shaves the ice to the
depth of three inches, is drawn by a horse, until the whole surface
of the ice is planed. The chips thus produced are then
scraped off; and if the clear ice is not reached, the process is
repeated. If this makes the ice too thin for cutting, it is left
in <i>statu quo</i>, and a few nights of hard frost will add below as
much as has been taken off above. In addition to filling
their ice-houses at the lake and in the large towns, the company
fill a large number of private ice-houses during the
winter, all the ice for these purposes being transported by
railway. It will easily be believed, that the expense of providing
tools, building houses, furnishing labour, and constructing
and keeping up the railway, is very great; but the
traffic is so extensive, and the management of the trade so
good, that the ice can be furnished, even in England, at a
very trifling <span class="locked">cost<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></span> (it is retailed at twopence per pound).]</p>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_397" id="Footnote_397" href="#FNanchor_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> This curious work contains so much valuable information respecting
the French manners in the sixteenth century, that some account of it may
not prove unacceptable to my readers. The title is, Déscription de L’Isle des
Hermaphrodites, nouvellement découverte ... pour servir de Supplement
au Journal de Henri III. The preface, to which there is no signature,
says that the book was printed for the first time in 1605. In the first
editions neither date nor place is mentioned; but one edition is dated
1612. It appears to have been written in the reign of Henry IV., after
the peace of Vervins, concluded in 1598, which the author mentions in
the beginning. Henry IV. would not suffer any inquiry to be made respecting
the author that he might be punished, because, he said, though
he had taken great liberty in his writing, he had written truth. He is
not therefore known. Some have conjectured that it was the production
of cardinal Perron, and others of sieur d’Emery, Thomas Artus. But the
former would not have chosen to lash vices such as those mentioned in
this satire, with so much wit and severity; and the latter could not have
done it. The one was too vicious, and the other too vehement. The cardinal
must have delineated his own picture; and Artus have exceeded
what he was capable of. The same opinion respecting Artus is entertained
by Marchand, in his Dict. Historique. The frontispiece, which
in many editions is wanting, represents an effeminate voluptuary with a
womanish face, dressed half in men’s and half in women’s clothing. Marchand
says the inscription is Les Hermaphrodites. In some editions
however it is much more cutting: “Pars est una patris; cætera matris
habet.” This pentameter is taken from Martial, lib. xiv. ep. 174. The
whole work is inserted also in Journal de Henri III., par Pierre de
l’Estoiles, à la Haye 1744, 8vo, iv. p. 1. For further information on this

<h2 id="hydrometer">HYDROMETER.</h2>

<p>This instrument, called in Latin <i>hydrometrum</i>, <i>hygroscopium</i>,
<i>hygrobaroscopium</i>, <i>hydroscopium</i>, <i>areometrum</i>, and <i>baryllion</i>,
serves to determine the weight or specific gravity of different
fluid masses, by the depth to which it sinks in them.</p>

<p>The laws respecting the comparative specific gravity of
fluids and solid bodies immersed in them were discovered by
Archimedes, when he tried the well-known experiment, by
order of Hiero king of Sicily, to find the content of a golden
crown, made for that sovereign. Upon these is founded the
construction of the hydrometer; and it is not improbable that
Archimedes, who was killed in the year 212 before the Christian
æra, was the inventor of it, though no proofs to warrant
this conjecture are to be found in the writings of that great
man, or in those of any other author.</p>

<p>The oldest mention of the hydrometer occurs in the fifth
century, and may be found in the letters of Synesius to Hypatia.
Of the lives of these two persons I must here give
some anecdotes, as they deserve to be known on account of
the singular fate which attended them. Hypatia was the
daughter of Theon, a well-known mathematician of Alexandria,
some of whose writings are still extant. By her father
she was instructed in mathematics, and from other great
men, who at that time abounded in Alexandria, she learned
the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, and acquired such
a complete knowledge of these sciences, that she taught them
publicly with the greatest applause. She was young and
beautiful, had a personable figure, was sprightly and agreeable
in conversation, though at the same time modest; and she
possessed the most rigid virtue, which was proof against every
temptation. She conducted herself with so much propriety
towards her lovers, that they never could obtain more than
the pleasure of her company and of hearing her discourse;
and with this, which they considered as an honour, they were
contented. Those who wished to intrude further were dismissed;
and she destroyed the appetite of one who would not
suffer her to philosophise, by means of some strong preparation,
which, as far as I know, remained a secret. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
not baptized, and with all her knowledge, adopted the blind
superstition of paganism. Had she been a Christian, and
suffered a cruel death from heathen persecution, she would
have merited a place in the martyrology of the saints: but
the case was reversed; for, by the conduct of the Christians
towards her, she became entitled to have her name enrolled
in the martyrology of the philosophers.</p>

<p>The patriarch of Alexandria, at the time when she lived,
was Cyril, whose family for a hundred years before had produced
bishops, who were of more service to their relations
than to the church. This prelate was a proud, litigious, vindictive
and intolerant man, who thought every thing lawful
which he conceived to be for the glory of God; and who, as
prosecutor and judge, condemned Nestorius without hearing
his defence. In the city of Alexandria, which was then very
flourishing on account of its commerce, the emperor allowed
greater toleration than he imagined could be justified to the
clergy in any other place; and it contained a great many
Jews, who carried on an extensive trade, as well as a number
of pagan families who were of service to the city, or at least
did it no harm. This, in the eyes of Cyril, was not proper;
he would have the sheep-fold clean, and the Jews must be
banished. Orestes, however, the governor, who was a man
of prudence, and better acquainted with the interests of the
city, opposed a measure that was likely to be attended with
mischief, and he even caused to be condemned to death a
Christian profligate, who had done some injury to the Jews.
This malefactor was, by the order of Cyril, buried in the
church as a martyr; and he immediately collected five hundred
monks, who ill-treated Orestes in the streets, and excited
an insurrection among the people, who plundered the unfortunate
Jews, and expelled them from a city in which they had
lived since the time of Alexander the Great.</p>

<p>Cyril, observing one day a great number of horses and
servants belonging to persons of the first rank, before a certain
house in the city, inquired the cause of their being assembled
in that manner. He was informed that the house
was the habitation of the celebrated female philosopher Hypatia,
who, on account of her extensive learning and eminent
talents, was visited not only by people of the highest distinction,
but even by the governor himself. This was sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
to excite the bishop’s jealousy against the unbelieving Hypatia,
and he resolved to effect her ruin. As he had instigated
the people against the Jews, he in like manner encouraged
them to attack Hypatia. They seized her in the street, hurried
her to the church, stripped off her clothes, tore her flesh
to pieces with potsherds, dragged her mangled limbs about
through the city, and at length burned them. This bloody
tragedy, which took place in the year 415, could tend only
to inspire the heathens with a greater hatred to Christianity,
and to make sensible Christians ashamed of the conduct of
their brethren. To Cyril, however, it occasioned no shame;
on the contrary, he endeavoured to divert the emperor from
punishing those who had been guilty of so gross a violation
of the principles of justice, and in this he was assisted by his
numerous adherents and friends. In some circumstances of
this relation historians are not agreed, but they all concur in
bestowing praise on Hypatia, whose memory was honoured
and preserved by her grateful and affectionate <span class="locked">scholars<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></span>.</p>

<p>Among these was Synesius, of a noble pagan family, who
cultivated philosophy and the mathematics with the utmost ardour,
and who had been one of her most intimate friends and
followers. On account of his learning, talents, and open disposition,
he was universally esteemed, and he had been employed
with great success on public occasions of importance. The
church at Ptolemais at length wished to have him for their
bishop. After much reluctance he accepted the office, but
on condition that they should not require him to acknowledge
the resurrection of the dead, which he doubted. The
people having consented to allow him this indulgence, he
suffered himself to be baptized, and became their bishop.
He was confirmed by the orthodox patriarch Theophilus, the
predecessor of Cyril, to whose jurisdiction Ptolemais belonged;
and he afterwards renounced his errors, and declared
himself convinced of the truth of the resurrection. This
learned man showed his gratitude to Hypatia, by the honourable
mention which he made of her in some letters that are
still preserved among his writings.</p>

<p>In his fifteenth letter, he tells Hypatia that he was so unfortunate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
or found himself so ill, that he wished to use a
<i>hydroscopium</i>, and he requests that she would cause one to
be constructed for him. “It is a cylindrical tube,” adds he,
“of the size of a reed or pipe. A line is drawn upon it
lengthwise, which is intersected by others, and these point
out the weight of water. At the end of the tube is a cone,
the base of which is joined to that of the tube, so that they
have both only one base. This part of the instrument is
called <i>baryllion</i>. If it be placed in water, it remains in a
perpendicular direction, so that one can discover by it the
weight of the fluid.”</p>

<p>Petavius, who published the works of Synesius in the year
1640, acknowledges in his annotations, that this passage he
did not understand. An old scholiast, he says, who had
added some illegible words, seemed to think that it referred
to a water-clock; but this he considers improbable, as a
clepsydra was not immersed in water, but filled with it. He
conjectures, therefore, that it may allude to some such instrument
as that which Vitruvius calls <i>chorobates</i>. The latter however
was employed for leveling; and it appears that Synesius,
who complains of the bad state of his health, could not
think of leveling. Besides, no part of the description in
Vitruvius agrees with that which is given in so clear a manner
by Synesius.</p>

<p>Petau published his edition of the works of this philosopher
in the time of Peter de Fermat, conseiller au parlement de
Toulouse, a man of great learning, who was an excellent mathematician,
and well-acquainted with antiquities and the
works of the ancients. We have by the latter a commentary
upon some obscure passages of Athenæus, annotations on the
writings of Theon of Smyrna, and emendations from a manuscript
to the Stratagemata of Polyænus, which may be found
also in his Miscellanies. Mursinna, in his edition of the same
author, has added them to the end of the preface. As Fermat
was often consulted respecting difficult passages of the
ancients, he could not be unacquainted with that in the new
edition of Synesius. He drew up an explanation of it, and
gave it to a friend who was then about to publish a French
translation of Bened. Castelli’s book, Della Misura dell’Acque
Correnti, and who caused it to be printed along with that
work. Fermat died in the year 1665. After his death his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
son published some of his writings under the title of Varia
Opera <span class="locked">Mathematica<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></span>; and in this collection is inserted his
short treatise on the <i>hydroscopium</i>, from which I have extracted
the following explanation.</p>

<p>It is impossible, says he, that the <i>hydroscopium</i> could be
the level or <i>chorobates</i> of Vitruvius, for the lines on the latter
were perpendicular to the horizon, whereas the lines on the
former were parallel to it. The <i>hydroscopium</i> was undoubtedly
a hydrometer of the simplest construction. The tube
may be made of copper, and open at the top; but at the other
end, which, when used, is the lowest, it must terminate with
a cone, the base of which is soldered to that of the tube.
Lengthwise, along the tube, are drawn two lines, which are
intersected by others, and the more numerous these divisions
are, the instrument will be so much more correct. When
placed in water, it sinks to a certain depth, which will be
marked by the cross lines, and which will be greater in proportion
to the lightness of the water. A figure, which is
added, illustrates this explanation more than was necessary.
When a common friend of Fermat and Petavius showed it to
the latter, he considered it to be so just, that he wished to
have an opportunity of introducing it in a new edition.</p>

<p>Mersenne, on the other hand, entertains some <span class="locked">doubt<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></span> respecting
this instrument, though he does not mention Fermat,
with whom he was well-acquainted; for in the dispute which
the latter had with Descartes, Mersenne was the bearer of
the letters that passed between them, as we learn from the
Life of Descartes, by Baillet. His objections however are of
little weight. Why should Synesius, asks Mersenne, consider
himself unfortunate, because he had not a hydrometer?
It may be here replied, that he was in an infirm state, and
that the physicians seem to have ordered him to drink no
water but what was pure and light. We know that in former
times, when so many artificial liquors were not in use, people
were accustomed, more than at present, to good water. We
read in the works of the ancient physicians, such as Galen
and Celsus, directions how to examine the lightness and purity
of water. He might have tried it, says Mersenne, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
common balance. He indeed might, but not so conveniently.
That Synesius was in a bad state of health is apparent from
several of his letters; otherwise one might say that in a letter
many expressions may be only jocular, respecting some circumstance
known to the friend to whom one writes; and
that every expression is not to be taken according to its literal
meaning. One might confess also, without weakening a received
explanation, not to know what Synesius alludes to in
the first line of his letter. But even if we allow that the
instrument was not a hydrometer, but a water-clock, or a
level; it may be asked how the want of these could make
him unfortunate? Mersenne thinks further, that the cone,
added to the end of the tube, would have been unnecessary
in a hydrometer; but it serves to keep the instrument with
more ease in a perpendicular direction in the water. Such is
the opinion of H. Klugel, whom I shall soon have occasion
to quote.</p>

<p>For the explanation of Fermat one may produce a still
stronger testimony, with which he seems not to have been
acquainted. It can be proved that this instrument was used
in the next, or at least in the sixth century. Of that period,
we have a Latin poem on weights and measures, which contains
a very just description of a hydrometer. The author,
in manuscripts, is called sometimes <i>Priscianus</i>, and sometimes
<i>Rhemnius Fannius Palæmon</i>; but we know, from grounds
which do not belong to this subject, that the former was his
real name. Two persons of that name are known at present.
The one, Theodore Priscian, was a physician, and lived in
the time of the emperor Valentinian, towards the end of the
fourth century. As more physicians have written on weights
and measures, with which it is indispensably necessary they
should be acquainted, one might conjecture that this Priscian
was the author of the above poem. The rest of his writings,
however, still preserved, are in so coarse and heavy a style,
that one can scarcely ascribe to him a work which is far from
being ill-written; especially as it is nowhere said that he
was a poet. With much more probability may we consider
as the author the well-known grammarian Priscian, who died
about the year 528.</p>

<p>This poem has been often printed, and not unfrequently
at the end of Q. Sereni Samonici De Medicina Præcepta.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
The best edition is that inserted by Wernsdorf in the fifth
part of the first volume of his Poetæ Minores, where an account
may be found of the other editions.</p>

<p>Be the author who he may, this much is evident, that he
was acquainted with the hydrometer of Synesius, and has described
it in a very clear manner.</p>

<p>“Fluids,” says he, “are different in weight, as may be
proved by the specific gravity of oil and honey compared
with that of pure water;” and the given proportion agrees
almost with that found by modern experiments. “This,”
adds he, “may be discovered by an instrument,” which he
thus describes:&mdash;“It consists of a thin metallic cylinder made
of silver or copper, about as large as the joint of a reed between
two knots, to the end of which is added a cone. This
cone makes the lower end so heavy, that the instrument, without
sinking or floating on the surface, remains suspended perpendicularly
in the water. Lengthwise, upon the cylinder, is
drawn a line, which is divided by cross lines into as many
parts as are equal to the weight of the instrument in <i>scripla</i>.
If placed in light fluids, more of the divisions will be covered
than when put into heavy fluids; or it sinks deeper into those
which are light than into those which are heavy. This difference
of gravity may be found also,” continues he, “by
filling vessels of equal size with the fluids and weighing them;
for the heavier must then weigh most; but when one takes
an equal weight of two fluids, the lighter will occupy more
space than the heavier. If twenty-one divisions of the instrument
are covered in water, and twenty-four in oil, and if
one take twenty-four <i>scripla</i> of water, twenty-one <i>scripla</i> of
oil only can be contained in the space occupied by the water.”
Such is the manner in which Professor Klugel has conjectured
the meaning of the author from hydrostatic principles;
though neither he nor Wernsdorf has ventured to give
a literal translation of the words which ought to convey this
explanation. But however obscure they may be, it evidently
appears that they allude to a hydrometer.</p>

<p>This poem was once published together with Celsus De Re
Medica, in 1566, by Robert Constantin, who died at an advanced
age in 1605, and who added a few, but excellent
notes, which have been inserted by Wernsdorf in his edition.
This Constantin seems to have known that the instrument of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Priscian and the <i>hydroscopium</i> of Synesius were the same;
and that they were used for determining the weight of fluids.
He explains the use of them very properly; but is mistaken
in supposing the cone to have been of wood, though it served
to render the lower part of the instrument heavier, as the
poet himself says: “cui cono interius modico pars ima gravatur.”
I am almost induced to think that <i>interius</i> implies
that additional weight was given to the cone by throwing
some small heavy bodies into it, through the opening above;
and at present grains of leaden shot are employed for that
purpose. It appears therefore that the honour of having
first given a good explanation of the before-quoted passage
of Synesius belongs rather to Constantin than to Fermat;
but I can readily believe that the latter was not acquainted
with the observations made on it by the former. Before I
conclude the history of this instrument among the ancients,
I shall add two remarks further. It is evidently wrong when
one, with Muschenbroek and others, whose opinion I adopted
before I engaged in this research, considers Hypatia as the
inventress of the hydrometer. It was known at her time, and
was made at Alexandria; but it seems not to have been very
common, as Synesius wrote to Hypatia to procure him one,
and even thought it necessary to give her a description of it.</p>

<p>Those are mistaken likewise, who say that this instrument
was called also <i>baryllium</i>. That word, as far as I have been
able to learn, occurs only in Synesius, who expressly tells us
that the small heavy cone alone was meant by it. In the
same manner has it been understood by Constantin. In the
Dictionary of Basle it is said to be <i>hydroscopii pars</i>; and in
Stephen’s Dictionary it is explained by <i>pondusculum</i>, as well
as in that of Ernest, where it is given as the diminutive of
<i>baros</i>. It signified therefore the heavy part of the hydrometer
only.</p>

<p>It is equally erroneous when one says, with Muschenbroek
and others, that those who among the Romans made it their
employment to examine the quality of water with the hydrometer,
were called <i>baryllistæ</i> or <i>barynilæ</i>. These words
do not occur in the works of the ancient Latin authors, nor
in any of the completest dictionaries. We read only the following
passage in some editions of the Commentary of Servius
upon Virgil: “Scrutatores et repertores aquarum (aquilices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
dicuntur) barinulas <span class="locked">dixerunt<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></span>.” If these words were really
written by Servius, who lived in the fifth century, he either
confounded the water-searchers, <i>aquilices</i>, those who sought
for springs, with those who examined the nature of water
when found, as the hydrometer was of no service to the
former in their business; or both employments must at that
time have been followed by the same people, and these must
have acquired their name from a part only of one instrument
they used, which is not at all probable.</p>

<p>I think we may with certainty believe that the hydrometer
was not known to Seneca, Pliny, or Galen, who died about
the end of the second century. Were not this the case, it
would certainly have been mentioned by the first, where he
speaks so minutely of the specific gravity of hard and fluid
<span class="locked">bodies<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></span>; by the second, where he says that the weight of
water was ascertained by a common <span class="locked">balance<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></span>; and by the
last, where he gives directions how to discover its lightness.
Galen adds, that in his time a method had been invented of
determining the quality of salt-lye by placing an egg in it, and
observing whether it <span class="locked">floated<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></span>. Have we not reason to think
that on this occasion the hydrometer must have occurred to
him had it been then used?</p>

<p>But however well-known it may have been in the fifth
century, it seems that it was afterwards entirely forgotten,
and that towards the end of the sixteenth it was again for
the first time revived or invented anew. To George Agricola
it was scarcely known; for where he speaks of the weight
of different kinds of water, and particularly of that of salt
<span class="locked">springs<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></span>, he does not mention it. Constantin, however, who
lived at the same time, must have been acquainted with it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
else he could not have explained the before-mentioned passages
of Synesius and Priscian.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the first account of the hydrometer
being again brought into use must be found in the
oldest German books on salt-works. It is at any rate certain
that from these the modern philosophers became first acquainted
with it. One of the earliest who has described it is
the Jesuit Cabeus, who wrote about the year <span class="locked">1644<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></span>; but he
confesses that he acquired his information from a German
treatise by Tholden, whom <span class="locked">Kircher<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></span> calls a German artist.
He was however not properly an artist. He was a native of
Hesse; a good chemist for his time; and resided about the
year 1600 or 1614 as overseer of the salt-works at Frankenhausen
in Thuringia. His treatise, which Cabeus had in his
possession, was entitled Tholden’s Haligraphia, printed at
Leipsic in 1603. Another edition, printed at the same place
in 1613, is mentioned by Draudius; but at present I have not
been able to find it; and can say only from Cabeus and
Leupold, that Tholden’s hydrometer had a weight suspended
to it; and that he speaks of the instrument not as a new but
a well-known invention, and on that account has described it
only imperfectly.</p>

<p>Kircher, whose works were generally read, seems to have
principally contributed towards making it publicly known;
and <span class="locked">Schott<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></span>, <span class="locked">Sturm<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></span> and others, in their account of it, refer
to his writings. The artists at Nuremberg, who worked in
glass, and who constructed a great many hydrometers which
were everywhere sold, assisted in this likewise. One, above
all, made by Michael Sigismund Hack, was highly valued
about the beginning of the last century, as we are told by
J. Henry Muller, professor at Altorf. Of this artist, often
mentioned by Sturm and other philosophers, an account has
been given by Doppelmayer. He died in 1724.</p>

<p>Many improvements, or perhaps only alterations, have been
made in this instrument in later times by a variety of artists.
The task of collecting these completely in chronological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
order with explanations, I shall leave to others; and only
mention a few of them. One of the first who endeavoured to
adapt the hydrometer for determining the specific gravity and
purity of metals was Monconys. Almost about the same
period Cornelius Mayer and Boyle seem to have conceived
the idea of facilitating the weighing of solid bodies by a
weighing-scale added to the instrument. The former affirms
that this improvement was invented by him as early as the
year <span class="locked">1668<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></span>; whereas Boyle did not make his known till
<span class="locked">1675<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></span>. Besides these the following also are worthy of notice:
<span class="locked">Feuille<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></span>, Fahrenheit, <span class="locked">Clark<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Leutmann<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></span>, whose
improvements have been described by <span class="locked">Wolf<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></span>, <span class="locked">Leupold<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></span>,
Gesner, Weigel and others.</p>

<p>[The principal hydrometer now in use is that of Sykes,
this is adopted in estimating excise duties on liquids. That
of Baumé is principally employed abroad. Those of Beck
or Cartier are but rarely used. These instruments differ
merely in their graduation. Sykes’s plan of increasing the
extent of the indications without enlarging the instrument is
ingenious. It is effected by means of a number of weights
which may be appended as collars to the stem of the instrument.</p>

<p>A useful method of ascertaining specific gravities for commercial
purposes, consists in using a series of glass beads,
previously adjusted and numbered. When thrown into any
liquid, the heavier ones sink and the lighter float on the
surface; but the one which has the same density as the liquid
will remain indifferent, or perhaps slightly below the
surface. The specific gravity is then found by the number
with which it is marked.]</p>

<h2 id="lighting">LIGHTING OF STREETS.</h2>

<p>The lighting of streets, while it greatly contributes to ornament
our principal cities, adds considerably also to the convenience
and security of the inhabitants. But of whatever
benefit it may be, it is generally considered as a modern invention.
M. St. Evremond says, “The invention of lighting
the streets of Paris during the night, by a multitude of lamps,
deserves that the most distant nations should go to see what
neither the Greeks nor the Romans ever thought of for the
police of their republics.” This opinion appears to be well-founded;
for I have never yet met with any information
which proves that the streets of Rome were lighted. Some
passages, indeed, in ancient authors rather indicate the contrary;
and according to my ideas, the Romans would not
have considered the use of flambeaux and lanterns so necessary
on their return from their nocturnal visits, as they seem
to have done, had their streets been lighted; though I will
allow that the public lighting of the streets in our cities does
not render links or lanterns altogether superfluous. Whoever
walked the streets of Rome at night without a lantern, was
under the necessity of creeping home in perfect darkness, and
in great <span class="locked">danger<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></span>, like Alexis in Athenæus. Meursius endeavours
to make it appear that the streets of Rome were lighted;
and in support of this opinion quotes Ammianus Marcellinus,
and the Life of Julius Cæsar in Suetonius; but his
arguments to me are far from being <span class="locked">convincing<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></span>. That
Naples was not lighted, appears from the return of Gito in
the night-time, mentioned by <span class="locked">Petronius<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></span>. Some circumstances
however related by ancient authors make it probable
that Antioch, Rome and a few other cities had public lanterns,
if not in all the streets, at least in those which were
most frequented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Libanius, who lived in the beginning of the fourth century,
says in his <span class="locked">Panegyric<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></span>, where he praises his native city Antioch,
“The light of the sun is succeeded by other lights,
which are far superior to the lamps lighted by the Egyptians
on the festival of Minerva of Sais. The night with us differs
from the day only in the appearance of the light: with
regard to labour and employment everything goes on well.
Some work continually; but others laugh and amuse themselves
with singing.” I cannot allow myself to imagine that
the sophist here considers it as a subject of praise to his native
city, that the inhabitants after sun-set did not sit in darkness,
but used lights to work by. It appears, therefore, that
he alludes to the lighting of the streets.</p>

<p>In another passage, in the oration to <span class="locked">Ellebichus<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></span>, the same
author tells us, that the ropes from which the lamps that
ornamented the city were suspended, had been cut by some
riotous soldiers, not far from a bath. “Proceeding,” says
he, “to a bath not far off, they cut with their swords the
ropes from which were suspended the lamps that afforded
light in the night-time, to show that the ornaments of the
city ought to give way to them.” This quotation indicates,
at any rate, that there were lamps suspended from ropes near
the baths and places of greatest resort. The following passage
of Jerome, however, seems to make it probable, or
rather certain, that the streets of Antioch were lighted. In the
altercation between a Luciferan and an Orthodox, he relates
that an adherent of the schismatic Lucifer disputed in the
street with a true believer till the streets were lighted, when
the listening crowd departed; and that they then spat in each
other’s face, and retired.</p>

<p>In the elegant edition of the works of that father, by Dominicus
Vallarsius, we have a short dissertation on the time
when this unmannerly dispute took place; and the editor
shows that it happened at Antioch in the year <span class="locked">378<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></span>.</p>

<p>Basilius the Great, in a letter to Martinianus, giving an
account of the miserable situation of his native city Cæsarea,
in Cappadocia, in the year 371, says they had nights without
lights (<i>noctes non illustratas</i>). Most commentators explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
this passage as if it meant that the lamps in the streets had
not been <span class="locked">lighted<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the streets, not only of Antioch, but also of Edessa,
in Syria, were lighted in the fifth century, seems proved by
a passage in the History of Jesue Stylites. It is there expressly
said, that Eulogius, governor of Edessa, about the year
505, ordered lamps to be kept burning in the streets during the
night; and that he employed for that purpose a part of the oil
which was before given to the churches and <span class="locked">monasteries<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></span>.</p>

<p>With regard to the public lighting of whole cities on festivals,
and particularly on joyful occasions, which we call
illuminations, that practice seems to be of great antiquity.
Of this kind was a particular festival of the <span class="locked">Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></span>, during
which lamps were placed before all the houses throughout
the country, and kept burning the whole <span class="locked">night<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></span>. During
that festival of the Jews, called <i>festum encæniorum</i>, the feast
of the Dedication of the Temple, which, according to common
opinion, was celebrated in December, and continued
eight days, a number of lamps were lighted before each of
their houses. A passage in Æschylus shows that such illuminations
were used also in Greece. At Rome, the forum
was lighted when games were exhibited in the night-time;
and Caligula, on a like occasion, caused the whole city to be
<span class="locked">lighted<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></span>. As Cicero was returning home late at night, after
Catiline’s conspiracy had been defeated, lamps and torches
were lighted in all the streets in honour of that great orator.
The emperor Constantine caused the whole city of Constantinople
to be illuminated with lamps and wax candles on
Easter <span class="locked">eve<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></span>. The fathers of the first century frequently
inveigh against the Christians, because, to please the heathens,
they often illuminated their houses, on idolatrous festivals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
in a more elegant manner than they. This they considered
as a species of <span class="locked">idolatry<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></span>. That the houses of the ancients
were illuminated on birth-days, by suspending lamps from
chains, is too well known to require any <span class="locked">proof<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></span>.</p>

<p>Of modern cities, Paris, as far as I have been able to learn,
was the first that followed the example of the ancients by lighting
its streets. As this city, in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, was much infested with street robbers and incendiaries,
the inhabitants were, from time to time, ordered to
keep lights burning, after nine in the evening, before the
windows of all the houses which fronted the street. This
order was issued in the year 1524, and renewed in 1526 and
<span class="locked">1553<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></span>; but in the month of October 1558, <i>falots</i> were
erected at the corners of the streets, or, when the street was
so long that it could not be lighted by one, three were erected
in three different parts of it. These lights had, in a certain
measure, a resemblance to those used in some mines; for we
are told, in the Grand Vocabulaire François<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a>, that <i>falot</i> is a
large vase filled with pitch, rosin, and other combustibles,
employed in the king’s palace and houses of princes to light
the courts. At that period there were in Paris 912 streets;
so that the number of lights then used must have been less
than 2736.</p>

<p>In the month of November, the same year, these lights
were changed for lanterns of the like kind as those used at
present. The lighting of the streets of Paris continued,
however, for a long time to be very imperfect, till the abbé
Laudati, an Italian of the Caraffa family, conceived the idea
of letting out torches and lanterns for hire. In the month of
March 1662, he obtained an exclusive privilege to this establishment
for twenty years; and he undertook to erect, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
certain places, not only in Paris, but also in other cities of
the kingdom, booths or posts where any person might hire a
link or lantern, or, on paying a certain sum, might be attended
through the streets by a man bearing a light. He
was authorised to receive from every one who hired a lantern
to a coach, five sous for a quarter of an hour; and from
every foot-passenger, three sous. To prevent all disputes in
regard to time, it was ordered that a regulated hour-glass
should be carried along with each lantern.</p>

<p>In 1667, however, the lighting of the city of Paris was put
on that footing on which it is at present. At the same time
the police was greatly improved, and it afterwards served as
a pattern to most of the other cities in Europe. Affairs of
judicature, and those respecting the public police, instead of
being committed, as before, to one magistrate, called the
“Lieutenant civil du prevost de Paris,” were by a royal
edict, of the month of March in the above year, divided between
two persons. One of them, who had the management
of judicial affairs, retained the old title; and the other, who
superintended the police, had that of “Lieutenant du prevost
de Paris pour la police,” or “Lieutenant général de
police.” The first lieutenant of police was Nicholas de Reynie,
a man who, according to the praises bestowed on him by
French writers, formed an epoch in the history of modern
police. In the History of Paris, so often already quoted, he
is called an enlightened, upright, and vigilant magistrate, as
zealous for the service of the king as for the good of the
public, and who succeeded so well in this new office, that we
may say, adds the author, it is to him, more than to any
other, that we are indebted for the good order which prevails
at present in Paris. The first useful regulation by
which La Reynie rendered a service to the police, was that
for improving the (<i>guet</i>) night-watch, and the lighting of the
streets. I can find no complete account of the changes
he introduced; but four years after, that is, on the 23rd
of May 1671, an order was made that the lanterns every
year should be lighted from the 20th of October till the end
of March in the year following, and even during moonlight;
because the latter was of little use in bad weather, and even
in fine weather was not sufficient to light some of the most
dangerous streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Before this period the streets were lighted only during the
four winter months; and on account of the numberless atrocities
committed in the night-time, when there were no lights,
the Parisians offered to contribute as much money as should
be sufficient to defray the expense of keeping the lamps
lighted throughout the whole winter. The lamps employed
by La Reynie were, on account of their likeness to a bucket,
called <i>lanternes à seau</i>, and succeeded those invented by one
Herault, called <i>lanternes à cul-de-lampe</i>.</p>

<p>When De Sartines held the office of lieutenant de police,
a premium was offered to whoever should discover the most
advantageous means of improving the lighting of the streets;
and the Academy of Sciences were to decide on the different
plans that might be proposed. In consequence of this offer,
a journeyman glazier, named Goujon, received a premium of
200 livres, and Messrs. Bailly, Le Roy, and Bourgeois de
Chateaublanc 2000 livres. To the last-mentioned gentleman
is ascribed the invention of the present reverberating lamps,
described by La Vieil, which were introduced in 1766.</p>

<p>In a small work, called an Essay on Lanterns, by a society
of literary <span class="locked">men<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></span>, which, though written to ridicule antiquarian
researches and certain persons at Paris, contains some
authentic information respecting the lighting of the streets,
we are told that reverberating lamps were invented by an
abbé P., who therefore, says the author humorously, is the
second abbé who can boast of having enlightened the first
city in the world. The superiority of these lamps cannot be
denied; but, besides their expense, they are attended with
this disadvantage when they hang in the middle of the street,
that they throw a shade over it, so that one cannot be known
by those who pass. In cities also, where people walk principally
in the middle of the streets, or where the streets are
broad, they are not very convenient, and they occasion a
stoppage when it is necessary to clean them.</p>

<p>In the year 1721, the lamps in Paris are said to have
amounted to 5772; but in the Tableau de Paris, printed in
1760, the number is reckoned to be only 5694, and in the
Curiosités de Paris, 1771, they are stated to be 6232.</p>

<p>In 1777, the road between Paris and Versailles, which is
about nine miles in length, was lighted at the yearly expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of 15,000 livres by the same contractors who lighted Paris.
The city of Nantes was lighted the same year; and in 1780
had 500 lamps. Strasburg began to be lighted in 1779.</p>

<p>If what Maitland says in his <span class="locked">history<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></span> be true, that in the
year 1414 an order was issued for hanging out lanterns to
light the streets, and if that regulation was continued after
the above period, which I very much doubt, then must it be
allowed that London preceded Paris in this useful establishment.
Maitland refers for his authority to Stow’s Survey of
London; but in the edition of that work published in 1633,
I find only, where a list of the magistrates is given, the following
information:&mdash;“1417, Mayor, Sir Henry Barton,
skinner. This Henry Barton ordained lanthorns with lights
to bee hanged out on the winter evenings, betwixt Hallontide
and Candlemasse.” Nothing more occurs in the edition by
Strype, published in 1720.</p>

<p>In the year 1668, when several regulations were made for
improving the streets, the Londoners were reminded that
they should hang out lanterns duly at the accustomed <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a></span>.
In the year 1690 this order was renewed, and every housekeeper
was required to hang out a light or lamp every night
as soon as it was dark, between Michaelmas and Lady-day;
and to keep it burning till the hour of twelve at night. In
the year 1716 it was ordained by an act of common council,
that all housekeepers, whose houses fronted any street, lane,
or public passage, should, in every dark night, that is, every
night between the second night after every full moon till the
seventh night after every new moon, set or hang out one or
more lights, with sufficient cotton wicks, that should continue
to burn from six o’clock at night till eleven o’clock of the
same night, under the penalty of one shilling. All these regulations,
however, seem to have been ineffectual, owing to
bad management. The city was lighted by contract, and the
contractors for liberty to light it were obliged to pay annually
to the city the sum of six hundred pounds. Besides,
the contractors received only six shillings per annum from
every housekeeper whose rent exceeded ten pounds; and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
persons who hung out a lantern and candle before their
houses were exempted from paying towards the public lamps.
The streets were lighted no more than one hundred and seventeen
nights; and as this gave great opportunity to thieves
and robbers to commit depredations in the night-time, the
lord mayor and common council judged it proper, in the year
1736, to apply to parliament for power to enable them to
light the streets of the city in a better manner; and an act
was accordingly passed, by which they were empowered to
erect a sufficient number of such sort of glass lamps as they
should judge proper, and to keep them burning from the setting
to the rising of the sun throughout the year. Instead
therefore of a thousand lamps, the number was now increased
to 4679; but as these even were not sufficient, several of the
wards made a considerable augmentation, so that the whole
could amount to no less than 5000. This, however, was not
the amount of all the lamps in London, but of those in what
is properly called the city and liberties. As this division
forms only a fifth part of London, Maitland reckons the
whole number of public and private lamps to have been,
even at that period, upwards of 15,000. The time of lighting
also, which before had been only 750 hours annually, was
increased to 5000. In our cities of Lower Saxony, the streets
of which are not so dark as those of London, the lighting
continues 1519 hours.</p>

<p>In the year 1744, owing to the great number of robberies
committed in the streets during the night, it was found necessary
to apply for another act of parliament to regulate still
farther the lighting of the city; and at that period this establishment
was placed upon that footing on which it now
stands.</p>

<p>The lamps of London, at present (1786), are all of crystal
glass; each is furnished with three wicks; and they are
affixed to posts placed at the distance of a certain number of
paces from each other. They are lighted every day in the
year at sunset. Oxford-street alone is said to contain more
lamps than all Paris. The roads, even, seven or eight miles
round London, are lighted by such lamps; and as these roads
from the city to different parts are very numerous, the lamps
seen from a little distance, particularly in the county of
Surrey, where a great many roads cross each other, have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
beautiful and noble effect. Birmingham was lighted, for the
first time, in 1733, with 700 lamps.</p>

<p>It appears that the streets of Amsterdam were lighted by
lanterns as early as 1669; for in the month of February that
year, the magistrates, who in 1665 had forbidden the use of
torches, issued an order against destroying the lamp-posts, to
which it was customary to fasten horses. This order, as well
as the instructions given to the lamp-lighters in 1669, may
be found in a work called the Privileges of the city of Amsterdam.
The lanterns were not of glass, but of horn; for
the lamp-lighters were ordered, in their instructions, to wipe
off every day the smoke of the train-oil which adhered to the
horn of the lanterns.</p>

<p>At the Hague an order was issued in the month of October
1553, that the inhabitants should place lights before their
doors during dark nights; and afterwards small stone buildings
were erected at the corners of the principal streets, in
which lights were kept burning; but in the year 1678 lamps
were fixed up in all the streets.</p>

<p>The streets of Copenhagen were first lighted by lamps in
1681; and on the 16th of July 1683 new regulations were
made, by which the plan was much improved, as well as that
of the night-watch.</p>

<p>The streets of Rome are not yet lighted. Sixtus V. was
desirous to introduce this improvement in the police, but he
met with insurmountable obstacles. That the benefit of
lighting might be enjoyed in some measure, he ordered the
number of the lights placed before the images of saints to
be augmented. De la Lande says, in his Travels, that
Venice had been lighted for some years before the period
when he wrote, by 3000 lamps. Messina and Palermo, in
Sicily, are both lighted.</p>

<p>Madrid, which till lately was the dirtiest of all the capital
cities of Europe, is at present as well lighted as <span class="locked">London<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></span>.
Valencia in Spain was some years ago indebted for this improvement
to Joachim Manuel Fos, then inspector of the manufactories.
Barcelona is lighted <span class="locked">also<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span>. Lisbon however
has no lights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The streets of Philadelphia are lighted, and on each side
there is a foot-pavement.</p>

<p>In the year 1672 the council of Hamburg made a proposal
to the citizens for lighting the streets. The year following
this proposal was accepted, but the lamps were not
fixed up till two years after, that is to say in 1675.</p>

<p>In the year 1679, Berlin had advanced so far towards this
improvement, that the inhabitants were obliged in turns to
hang out a lantern with a light at every third house. In
1682, the Elector Frederick William caused lamp-posts with
lamps to be erected, notwithstanding the opposition made by
the inhabitants on account of the expense. In a petition
which they presented in 1680, they stated that the lamps cost
5000 dollars, and that 3000 were required yearly to keep
them lighted. At present Berlin has 2354 lamps, which are
kept lighted from September till May, and at the king’s expense.
Potsdam has <span class="locked">590<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></span>.</p>

<p>Vienna began to be lighted in the year 1687. The lights
were hung out in the evening on a signal given by the fire-bell.
In 1704 lamps were introduced; but at first the light
which they afforded was very imperfect, as the lamps burned
badly, and because, to save the expense of lamp-lighters,
every housekeeper was obliged daily to remove the empty
lamps, to carry them to the lamp-office to be filled, and to
light them again on a signal given with a bell. In 1776, the
lamps, which before amounted to 2000, were increased to
3000, and a contract was entered into for lighting them at
the rate of 30,000 florins. These lamps were invented by
counsellor Sonnenfels, and amounted in 1779 to 3445. They
are made of white glass, in a globular form, and have a covering
of tin-plate, painted red on the outside and polished within.
They are supported by lamp-irons, fixed in the houses at the
height of fifteen feet from the earth. Each lantern is only
sixteen paces distant from the other, so that the streets are
completely illuminated. They are kept lighted both summer
and winter, whether the moon shines or not; and this is more
necessary at Vienna than anywhere else, on account of the
height of the houses and the narrowness and crookedness of
the streets. The lamp-lighters wear an uniform, and are under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
military discipline. In 1783 the yearly expense of the lamps
was estimated at only 17,000 <span class="locked">florins<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></span>.</p>

<p>Leipzig was lighted in 1702, and Dresden in 1705. In
1766, the number of lamps at the latter amounted only to
728, for the lighting of which oil of rape-seed was employed.</p>

<p>In Cassel the streets began to be lighted under the Landgrave
Charles, in 1721; but as regulations were not made sufficient
to support this improvement, it was at length dropped.
It was however revived in 1748, and in 1778 the number
of the lamps was increased to 1013, besides those at the landgrave’s
palace.</p>

<p>Hanover was lighted in 1696, Halle in 1728, and Göttingen
in 1735. Brunswick since 1765 has had 1565 lamps. Zurich
has been lighted since 1778, but the lamps are very few in
number.</p>

<p>[Such was the state of street-lighting towards the end of
the last century, and many of the readers of this work will
remember the round glass lamps and their dismal oil-light,
which long after the streets of London were illuminated with
gas, still continued to be employed in the outskirts of this
immense metropolis. How changed is all this now, and how
surprising must it appear, that a thing so simple as the employment
of the combustible gases produced in the distillation
of coal and other bodies of organic origin should date
from so recent a period! But such is the case with most of
the improvements which tend to the comfort and happiness
of the human race; slow and by degrees they progress towards
perfection,&mdash;a fact most admirably illustrated by numerous
articles contained in these volumes.</p>

<p>The first idea of applying coal-gas to œconomical purposes
is generally attributed to Mr. William Murdoch, who in 1792
employed coal-gas for lighting his house and offices at Redruth
in Cornwall, and in 1798 constructed the apparatus for the
purpose of lighting Boulton and Watt’s celebrated manufactory
at Soho, near Birmingham, which on the occasion of the
peace in 1802 was publicly illuminated by the same means.
This display vastly attracted public attention to the subject,
and soon after several manufacturers whose works required
light and heat adopted the use of gas; a button manufactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
at Birmingham used it largely for soldering; Halifax, Manchester
and other towns soon followed. A single cotton-mill
in Manchester used above 900 burners, and had several miles
of pipe laid down to supply them. Mr. Murdoch, who erected
the apparatus used in this mill, sent a detailed account of his
operations to the Royal Society in 1808, and received the
gold medal of that body. It appears, however, from an interesting
paper by R. C. Taylor on the coal-fields of <span class="locked">China<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></span>,
that the Chinese, if not manufacturers, are nevertheless gas
consumers and employers on a grand scale, and have evidently
been so ages before the knowledge of its application
was acquired by Europeans. Beds of coal are frequently
pierced by the borers for salt water; and the inflammable
gas is forced up in jets twenty or thirty feet in height. From
these fountains the vapour has been conveyed to the salt-works
in pipes, and there used for the boiling and evaporation
of the salt; other tubes convey the gas intended for
lighting the streets and the larger apartments and kitchens.
As there is still more gas than required, the excess is conducted
beyond the limits of the salt-works, and there forms
separate chimneys or columns of flame. But this, like many
other discoveries of the Chinese, remained, owing to their
exclusive habits, unknown to us till within a recent period,
and the world may fairly be said to be indebted to Mr.
Winsor, for the vast benefit conferred upon it by gas-illumination.
After several experiments, this gentleman in
1803&ndash;1804 lighted the Lyceum theatre, and shortly afterwards,
in 1807, one side of Pall-Mall with gas distilled
from coal. Soon after that period companies were formed
for carrying on the manufacture of gas upon an extensive
scale, oil-lamps were banished from all the great thoroughfares
of the metropolis, and in the course of fifteen years not
only was every street and alley illuminated from the same
source, but it was generally introduced into shops and houses,
was carried into the suburbs, and has now become general in
every town and city of the empire.</p>

<p>It would lead us too far to enter into minute details concerning
the structure, uses and arrangement of the various
apparatus employed in the production of gas; it will suffice
to observe that when coal is heated to redness in a close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
vessel, it yields a variety of products which may be classed
under three heads, as,&mdash;1st, permanent gases; 2ndly, vapours
condensable into the liquid or solid state by cooling; and
3rdly, the residuary matter, coke, which remains in the retort.
The object of gas manufacture is to separate these from
each other, and to purify the gaseous products by washing
and other means, so as to render them fit for combustion.</p>

<p>The following particulars, taken from Brande’s Dictionary
of Science, may serve to give an idea of the quantity of gas
annually consumed in London. The oldest of the London
gas-works is the establishment belonging to the original chartered
company. They have three stations; the largest situated
in Peter-street, Westminster; the second in Brick-lane,
St. Luke’s, and the third in the Curtain-road, Shoreditch.
This company consumes 50,000 chaldrons of coals annually,
the produce of which in gas may be estimated at about six
hundred million cubic feet, or about eighteen million seven
hundred and fifty thousand pounds <i>weight</i> of gas. It may be
assumed that each chaldron of coals weighs 2880 lbs., and
yields an average produce of 12,000 cubic feet of purified
gas. The prime cost of gas is about four or five shillings per
1000 cubic feet; the usual retail price is from seven to ten
shillings per 1000 cubic feet.</p>

<p>The chartered company probably supplies about a fifth
part of the whole of the gas consumed in London and the
suburbs; so that the total annual consumption of coal employed
for this important manufacture in the London district
only, probably exceeds two hundred and fifty thousand chaldrons,
and the quantity of gas produced for the supply of this
district amounts annually to three thousand million cubic
feet. The <i>weight</i> of this quantity of gas exceeds seventy-five
millions of pounds; and the <i>light</i> produced by its combustion
may be considered as equivalent to that which would be obtained
by the combustion of one hundred and sixty millions
of pounds of mould-candles of six to the pound.</p>

<p>The operations of the London Gas-light Company, which
was established in the year 1833, are also on a scale of great
magnitude. Their works, situated at Vauxhall, are not only
the most powerful, but the most complete in arrangement of
any in the world. From this point their mains ramify to a
prodigious extent in Middlesex as well as Surrey, and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
admirable mode in which they are laid, aided by the power
of their works, they are enabled to supply gas at Highgate
Hill (seven miles distance) with the same precision and in the
same abundance as at Vauxhall. The extent of their pipes
exceeds one hundred and fifty miles.</p>

<p>The cost of light equivalent to that of seven mould candles
(six to the pound) is in coal-gas three farthings per hour, in
an Argand oil-lamp 3<i>d.</i> per hour, in mould candles 3½<i>d.</i> per
hour, and in wax candles 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per hour.</p>

<p>Gas has also been manufactured from oil, rosin and other
substances. Oil-gas is procured abundantly by the decomposition
of oil, trickled into a red-hot retort, half-filled with
coke or brick. It contains no sulphuretted hydrogen, requires
no purification, and is much richer in carburetted hydrogen
than coal-gas. Its expense has however led nearly to the
entire disuse of this kind of gas.</p>

<p>In London there are eighteen public gas establishments
and twelve companies; the capital invested in works and
apparatus is estimated at 3,000,000<i>l.</i>]</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="night">NIGHT-WATCH.</h2>

<p>The establishment of those people who are obliged to keep
watch in the streets of cities during the night, belongs to the
oldest regulations of police. Such watchmen are mentioned
in the Song of Solomon, and they occur also in the book of
Psalms. Athens and other cities of Greece had at least sentinels
posted in various parts; and some of the <i>thesmothetæ</i>
were obliged to visit them from time to time, in order to keep
them to their <span class="locked">duty<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></span>. At Rome there were <i>triumviri nocturni</i>,
<i>cohortes vigilum</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
The object of all these institutions seems to have been
rather the prevention of fires than the guarding against nocturnal
alarms or danger; though in the course of time attention
was paid to these also. When Augustus wished to
strengthen the night-watch, for the purpose of suppressing
nocturnal commotions, he used as a pretext the apprehension
of fires only. The regulations respecting these watchmen,
and the discipline to which they were subjected, were almost
the same as those for night-sentinels in camps during the
time of war; but it does not appear that the night-watchmen
in cities were obliged to prove their presence and vigilance
by singing, calling out, or by any other means. Signals were
made by the patroles alone, with bells, when the watchmen
wished to say anything to each other. Singing by sentinels
in time of war was customary, at least among some nations;
but in all probability that practice was not common in the
time of <span class="locked">peace<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></span>.</p>

<p>Calling out the hours seems to have been first practised
after the erection of city gates, and, in my opinion, to have
taken its rise in Germany; though indeed it must be allowed
that such a regulation would have been very useful in ancient
Rome, where there were no clocks, and where people had
nothing in their houses to announce the hours in the night-time.
During the day people could know the hours after
water-clocks had been constructed at the public expense, and
placed in open buildings erected in various parts of the city.
The case seems to have been the same in Greece; and rich
families kept particular servants both male and female, whose
business it was to announce to their masters and mistresses
certain periods of the day, as pointed out by the city clocks.
These servants consisted principally of boys and young girls,
the latter being destined to attend on the ladies. It appears,
however, that in the course of time water-clocks were kept
also in the palaces of the great: at any rate Trimalchio, the
celebrated voluptuary mentioned in Petronius, had one in his
dining-room, and a servant stationed near it to proclaim the
progress of the hours, that his master might know how much
of his lifetime was spent; for he did not wish to lose a single
moment without enjoying pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
I have not read everything that has been written by others
on the division of time among the ancients; but after the researches
I have made, I must confess that I do not know whether
the hours were announced in the night-time to those
who wished and had occasion to know them. There were
then no clocks which struck the hours, as has been already
said; and as water-clocks were both scarce and expensive,
they could not be procured by labouring people, to whom it
was of most importance to be acquainted with the progress
of <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></span>. It would therefore have been a useful and necessary
regulation to have caused the watchmen in the streets to
proclaim the hours, which they could have known from the
public water-clocks, by blowing a horn, or by calling out.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that people must have been soon led to
such an institution, because the above methods had been long
practised in war. The periods for mounting guard were determined
by water-clocks; at each watch a horn was blown,
and every one could by this signal know the hour of the
<span class="locked">night<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></span>; but I have met with no proof that these regulations
were established in cities during the time of peace, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
many modern writers have not hesitated to refer to the night-watch
in cities what alludes only to nocturnal guards in the
time of war. On the contrary, I am still more strongly inclined
to think that ancient Rome was entirely destitute of
such a police establishment. The bells borne by the night
watchmen were used only by the patroles, as we are expressly
told, or to give signals upon extraordinary occasions, such as
that of a fire, or when any violence had been committed.
Cicero, comparing the life of a civil with that of a military
officer, says, “The former is awaked by the crowing of the
cock, and the latter by the sound of the trumpet.” The
former therefore had no other means of knowing the hours
of the night but by attending to the noise made by that <span class="locked">animal<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></span>.
An ancient poet says that the cock is the trumpeter
which awakens people in the time of <span class="locked">peace<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></span>. The ancients
indeed understood much better than the vulgar at present,
who are already too much accustomed to clocks, how to determine
the periods of the night by observing the stars; but
here I am speaking of capital cities, and in these people are
not very fond of quitting their beds to look at the stars, which
are not always to be seen.</p>

<p>Without entering into further researches respecting watchmen
among the ancient Greeks and Romans, I shall prove,
by such testimonies as I am acquainted with, that the police
establishment of which I speak is more modern in our cities
than one might suppose. But I must except Paris; for it
appears that night-watching was established there, as at
Rome, in the commencement of its monarchy. De la <span class="locked">Mare<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></span>
quotes the ordinances on this subject of Clothaire II., in the
year 595, of Charlemagne, and of the following periods. At
first the citizens were obliged to keep watch in turns, under
the command of a <i>miles gueti</i>, who was called also <i>chevalier</i>.
The French writers remark on this circumstance, that the
term <i>guet</i>, which occurs in the oldest ordinances, was formed
from the German words <i>wache</i>, <i>wacht</i>, the guard, or watch;
and in like manner several other ancient German military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
terms, such as <i>bivouac</i>, <i>landsquenet</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> have been retained
in the French language. In the course of time, when general
tranquillity prevailed, a custom was gradually introduced of
avoiding the duty of watching by paying a certain sum of
money, until at length permanent <i>compagnies de guet</i> were
established in Paris, Lyons, Orleans, and afterwards in other
cities.</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken, the establishment of single watchmen,
who go through the streets and call out the hours, is
peculiar to Germany, and was copied only in modern times
by our neighbours. The antiquity of it however I will not
venture to <span class="locked">determine<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></span>. At Berlin, the elector John George
appointed watchmen in the year <span class="locked">1588<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></span>; but in 1677 there
were none in that capital, and the city officers were obliged
to call out the <span class="locked">hours<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></span>. Montagne, during his travels in
1580, thought the calling out of the night-watch in the German
cities a very singular custom. “The watchmen,” says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
he, “went about the houses in the night-time, not so much
on account of thieves as on account of fires and other alarms.
When the clocks struck, the one was obliged to call out aloud
to the other, and to ask what it was o’clock, and then to wish
him a good <span class="locked">night<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></span>.” This circumstance he remarks also when
speaking of Inspruck. Mabillon likewise, who made a literary
tour through Germany, describes calling out the hours
as a practice altogether peculiar to that country.</p>

<p>The horn of our watchmen seems to be the <i>buccina</i> of the
ancients, which, as we know, was at first an ox’s horn, though
it was afterwards made of <span class="locked">metal<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></span>. Rattles, which are most
proper for cities, as horns are for villages, seem to be of later
<span class="locked">invention<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></span>. The common form, “Hear, my masters, and let
me tell you,” is very old. I am not the only person to whom
this question has occurred, why it should not rather be, “Ye
people, or citizens.” The chancellor von Ludwig deduces it
from the Romans, who, as he says, were more liberal with the
word Master, like our neighbours with Messieurs, than the
old Germans; but the Roman watchmen did not call out, nor
yet do the French at present. If I may be allowed a conjecture
on so trifling an object, I should say that the city servants
or beadles were the first persons appointed to call out
the hours, as was the case at Berlin. These therefore called
out to their masters, and “Our masters” is still the usual appellation
given to the magistrates in old cities, particularly in
the central and southern portions of Germany, and in Switzerland.
At Göttingen the ancient form was abolished in
the year 1791, and the watchmen call out now, “The clock
has struck ten, it is ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>Watchmen who were stationed on steeples by day as well
as by night, and who, every time the clock struck, were
obliged to give a proof of their vigilance by blowing a horn,
seem to have been first established on a permanent footing in
Germany, and perhaps before watchmen in the streets. In
England there are none of these watchmen; and in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
they are very rare beyond the boundaries of Germany. That
watchmen were posted on the tops of towers, in the earliest
ages, to look out for the approach of an enemy, is well known.
In the times of feudal dissension, when one chief, if he called
in any assistance, could often do a great deal of hurt to a
large city, either by plundering and burning the suburbs and
neighbouring villages, or by driving away the cattle of the
citizens, and attacking single travellers, such precaution was
more necessary than at present. The nobility therefore kept
in their strong castles watchmen, stationed on towers; and
this practice prevailed in other countries besides Ireland and
<span class="locked">Burgundy<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></span>. It appears by the laws of Wales, that a watchman
with a horn was kept in the king’s <span class="locked">palace<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></span>. The German
princes had in their castles, at any rate in the sixteenth
century, tower-watchmen, who were obliged to blow a horn
every morning and evening.</p>

<p>At first, the citizens themselves were obliged to keep watch
in turns on the church-steeples, as well as at the town-gates;
as may be seen in a police ordinance of the city of <span class="locked">Einbeck<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></span>,
in the year 1573. It was the duty of these watchmen, especially
where there were no town clocks, to announce certain
periods, such as those of opening and shutting the city-gates.
The idea of giving orders to these watchmen to attend not
only to danger from the enemy but from fire also, and, after
the introduction of public clocks, to prove their vigilance by
making a signal with their horn, must have naturally occurred;
and the utility of this regulation was so important,
that watchmen on steeples were retained, even when cities, by
the prevalence of peace, had no occasion to be apprehensive
of hostile incursions.</p>

<p>After this period persons were appointed for the particular
purpose of watching; and small apartments were constructed
for them in the steeples. At first they were allowed to have
their wives with them; but this was sometimes prohibited,
because a profanation of the church was apprehended. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
most, if not in all cities, the town-piper, or as we say at present,
town-musician, was appointed steeple-watchman; and
lodgings were assigned to him in the steeple; but in the
course of time, as these were too high and too inconvenient,
a house was given him near the church, and he was allowed
to send one of his servants or domestics to keep watch in his
stead. This is the case still at Göttingen. The city musician
was called formerly the <i>Hausmann</i>, which name is still
retained here as well as at the Hartz, in Halle, and several
other places; and the steeple in which he used to dwell and
keep watch was called the <i>Hausmann’s Thurm</i><a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>. These establishments,
however, were not general; and were not everywhere
formed at a period equally early, as will be shown by
the proofs which I shall here adduce.</p>

<p>If we can credit an Arabian author, whose Travels were
published by Renaudot, the Chinese were accustomed, so
early as the ninth century, to have watchmen posted on
towers, who announced the hours of the day as well as of the
night, by striking or beating upon a suspended board. Marco
Paulo, who, in the thirteenth century, travelled through Tartary
and China, confirms this account; at least in regard to
a city which he calls Quinsai, though he says that signals
were given only in cases of fire and disturbance. Such boards
are used in China even at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></span>; and in Petersburg the
watchmen who are stationed at single houses or in certain
parts of the city, are accustomed to announce the hours by
beating on a suspended plate of iron. Such boards are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
used by the Christians in the Levant to assemble people to
divine service, either because they dare not ring bells or are
unable to purchase them. The former is related by Tournefort
of the inhabitants of the Grecian islands, and the latter
by Chardin of the Mingrelians. The like means were employed
in monasteries, at the earliest periods, to give notice
of the hours of prayer, and to awaken the <span class="locked">monks<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></span>. Mahomet,
who in his form of worship borrowed many things from the
Christians of Syria and Arabia, adopted the same method of
assembling the people to prayers; but when he remarked that
it appeared to his followers to savour too much of Christianity,
he again introduced the practice of calling out.</p>

<p>The steeple-watchmen in Germany are often mentioned in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In the year 1351, when
the council of Erfurt renewed that police ordinance which
was called the <i>Zuchtbrief</i>, letter of discipline, because it kept
the people in proper subjection, it was ordered, besides other
regulations in regard to fire, that two watchmen should be
posted on every steeple. A watchman of this kind was appointed
at Merseburg and Leisnig so early as the year 1400.
In the beginning of the seventeenth century the town-piper
of Leisnig lived still in apartments in the steeple. In the
year 1563, a church-steeple was erected in that place, and an
apartment built in it for a permanent watchman, who was
obliged to announce the hours every time the clock struck.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the city of Ulm kept permanent
watchmen in many of the steeples. In the year 1452 a bell
was suspended in the tower of the cathedral of Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
which was to be rung in times of feudal alarm,
and all the watchmen on the steeples were then to blow their
horns and hoist their banners. In the year 1476, a room for
the watchman was constructed in the steeple of the church
of St. Nicholas. In the year 1509, watchmen were kept both
on the watch-towers and steeples, who gave notice by firing
a musket when strangers approached. The watchman on the
tower of the cathedral immediately announced, by blowing a
trumpet, whether the strangers were on foot or on horseback;
and at the same time hung out a red flag towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
quarter in which he observed them advancing. The same
watchman was obliged, likewise, to blow his horn on an alarm
of fire; and that these people might be vigilant day and night,
both in winter and summer, the council supplied them with
fur-cloaks, seven of which, in the above-mentioned year, were
purchased for ten florins and a half.</p>

<p>In the year 1496, the large clock was put up in the steeple
of Oettingen, and a person appointed to keep watch on <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></span>.
In 1580, Montagne was much surprised to find on the steeple
at Constance a man who kept watch there continually; and
who, on no account, was permitted to come down from his
station.</p>

<p>[One of the greatest improvements of modern times, in
this country, is the establishment of that highly efficient body,
the new police. The first introduction of the police was
made by the magistrates of Cheshire in 1829, under an authority
from parliament (Act 10 Geo. IV. c. 97). The first
metropolitan establishment was also made in 1829. Before
this time the total old force of the metropolitan watchmen
consisted of 797 parochial day officers, 2785 night-watch, and
upward of 100 private watchmen; including the Bow-street
day and night patrol, there were about 4000 men employed
in the district stretching from Brentford Bridge on the west
to the river Lea on the east, and from Highgate on the north
to Streatham on the south, excluding the city of London.
The act of parliament creating the new police force (10 Geo.
IV. c. 44) placed the control of the whole body in the hands
of two commissioners, who devote their whole time to their
duties. The total number of the metropolitan police in January
1840 consisted of 3486 men. These are arranged in
divisions, each of which is employed in a distinct district.
The metropolis is divided into “beats” and is watched day
and night. Since August 1839, the horse-patrol, consisting
of seventy-one mounted men, who are employed within a distance
of several miles around London, has been incorporated
with the metropolitan police. The Thames police consists of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
twenty-one surveyors, each of whom has charge of three men
and a boat when on duty. The establishment is under the
immediate direction of the magistrates of the Thames police-office.</p>

<p>The police affairs of the city of London are still under its
own management. In 1833, the number of persons employed
in the several wards of the city was,&mdash;ordinary watchmen,
500; superintending watchmen, 65; patrolling watchmen,
91; beadles, 54; total, 710. There are about 400 men doing
duty in the city at midnight. In addition to the paid watchmen,
about 400 ward-constables are appointed. The expense
of the day-police, consisting of about 120 men, amounts to
about £9000 a year, and is defrayed by the corporation: and
the sum levied on the wards for the support of the night-watch
averages about £42,000 per annum.</p>

<p>The police of the metropolis and the district within fifteen
miles of Charing Cross (exclusive of the city) is regulated by
the acts 10 Geo. IV. c. 44, and 2 and 3 Vict. c. 47. In nearly
all the boroughs constituted under the Municipal Reform
Act, a paid police force has been established on the same
footing as the metropolitan police.]</p>

year 1253 Henry III. commanded watches in the cities and borough
towns to be kept, for the better observing of peace and quietness among
his people.... And further, by the advice of them of Savoy, he ordained,
that if any man chanced to be robbed, or by any means damnified by any
thief or robber, he to whom the charge of keeping that country, city, or
borough, chiefly appertained, where the robbery was done, should competently
restore the loss. And this was after the use of Savoy, but yet
thought more hard to be observed here than in those parts; and therefore,
leaving those laborious watches, I will speak of our pleasures and
pastimes in watching by night.” (Survey of London, Thoms’s edition,

these watches were continued in his time; nor does he state the
author of the information which he gives us from his reading. The
statute of Winchester, 13 Edward I. c. 4, enforces a continuation of the
watches as they had previously been made, from Ascension-day to Michaelmas-day;
the night-watch from sun-set to sunrise, in every city

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="plant">PLANT-SKELETONS.</h2>

<p>Plants, as well as animals, are organised bodies, and like
them their parts may be dissected and decomposed by art;
but the anatomy of the former has not been cultivated so
long and with so much zeal and success as that of animals.
Some naturalists, about the beginning of the last century,
first began to make it an object of attention, to compare the
structure of plants with that of animals; and for that purpose
to employ the microscope. Among these, two distinguished
themselves in a particular manner; Marcellus Malpighi, an
Italian; and Nehemiah Grew, an Englishman; who both
undertook almost the same experiments and made them
known at the same time; so that it is impossible to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
which of them was the earlier. It appears, however,
that Grew published some of his observations a little sooner;
but Malpighi was prior in making his known in a complete
manner. But even allowing that the one had received hints
of the processes of the other, they are both entitled to praise
that each made experiments of his own, and from these prepared
figures, which are always more correct the nearer they
correspond with each other.</p>

<p>Among the various helps towards acquiring a knowledge
of the anatomy of plants, one of the principal is the art of reducing
to skeletons leaves, fruit and roots; that is, of freeing
them from their soft, tender and pulpy substance, in such a
manner, that one can survey alone their internal, harder vessels
in their entire connexion. This may be done by exposing
the leaves to decay for some time soaked in water, by
which means the softer parts will be dissolved, or at least
separated from the internal harder parts, so that one, by carefully
wiping, pressing and rinsing them, can obtain the latter
alone perfectly entire. One will possess then a tissue composed
of innumerable woody threads or filaments, which, in
a multiplicity of ways, run through and intersect each other.
By sufficient practice and caution one may detach, from each
side of a leaf, a very thin covering, between which lies a delicate
web of exceedingly tender vessels. These form a
woody net-work, between the meshes of which fine glandules
are distributed. This net is double, or at least can be divided
lengthwise into halves, between which may be observed
a substance that appears as it were to be the marrow of the
plant. Persons who are expert often succeed so far, with
many leaves, as to separate the external covering on both
sides from the woody net, and to split the latter into two, so
that the whole leaf seems to be divided into four.</p>

<p>One might conjecture that this method of reducing leaves
to skeletons must have been long known, as one frequently
finds in ponds leaves which have dropped from the neighbouring
trees, and which by decomposition, without the assistance
of art, have been converted into such a woody net-work,
quite perfect and entire. It is however certain that a
naturalist, about the year 1645, first conceived the idea of
employing decomposition for the purpose of making leaf-skeletons,
and of assisting it by ingenious operations of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
This naturalist, Marcus Aurelius Severinus, professor of
anatomy and surgery at Naples, was born in 1580, and died
of the plague in 1656. In his Zootomia Democritæa, printed
in 1645, he gave the figure, with a description of a leaf of the
<i>Ficus Opuntia</i> reduced to a skeleton. Of the particular process
employed to prepare this leaf, the figure of which is very
coarse and indistinct, he gives no account. He says only
that the soft substance was so dissolved that the vessels or
nerves alone remained; and that he had been equally successful
with a leaf of the palm-tree. A piece of a leaf of the
like kind he sent by Thomas Bartholin to Olaus Wormius,
who caused it to be engraved on copper, in a much neater
manner, without saying anything of the method in which it
had been <span class="locked">prepared<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></span>. The process Severin kept secret; but
he communicated it to Bartholin, in a letter, on the 25th of
February 1645, on condition that he would not disclose it to
any one. At that period, however, it excited very little attention,
and was soon forgotten, though in the year 1685 one
Gabriel Clauder made known that he had reduced vine-leaves,
the calyx of the winter cherry, and a root of hemlock, to a net
or tissue by burying them in sand during the heat of summer,
and hanging them up some months in the open air till they
were completely dried.</p>

<p>This art was considered to be of much more importance
when it was again revived by the well-known Dutchman,
Frederick Ruysch. That naturalist found means to conduct
all his undertakings and labours in such a manner as to excite
great wonder; but we must allow him the merit of having
brought the greater part of them to a degree of perfection
which no one had attained before. By the anatomy of animals,
in which he was eminently skilled, he was led to the
dissection of plants; and as it seemed impossible to fill their
tender vessels, like those of animals, with a coloured solid
<span class="locked">substance<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></span>, he fell upon a method of separating the hard parts
from the soft, and of preserving them in that manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
For this purpose he first tried a method which he had employed
with uncommon success, in regard to the parts of animals.
He covered the leaves and fruit with insects, which
ate up the soft or pulpy parts, and left only those that were
hard. But however well these insects, which he called his
little assistants, may have executed their task, they did not
abstain altogether from the solid parts, so that they never
produced a complete skeleton. He dismissed them, therefore,
and endeavoured to execute with his own fingers what
he had before caused the insects to perform, after he had separated
the soft parts from the hard by decomposition. In
this he succeeded so perfectly, that all who saw his skeletons
of leaves or fruit were astonished at the fineness of the work
and wished to imitate them.</p>

<p>I cannot exactly determine the year in which Ruysch began
to prepare these skeletons. Trew thinks that it must have
been when he was in a very advanced age, or at any rate after
the year 1718; for when he was admitted to Ruysch’s collection
in that year, he observed none of these curiosities.
Rundmann, however, saw some of them in his possession in
the year <span class="locked">1708<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></span>. At first Ruysch endeavoured to keep the
process a secret, and to evade giving direct answers to the
questions of the curious. We are informed by Rundmann,
that he attempted to imitate his art by burying leaves at the
end of harvest in the earth, and leaving them there till the
spring, by which their soft parts became so tender that he
could strip them off with the greatest ease. He produced also
the same effect by boiling them.</p>

<p>The first account which Ruysch himself published of his
process, was, as far as I know, in the year 1723. After he
had sufficiently excited the general curiosity, he gave figures
of some of his vegetable skeletons, related the whole method
of preparing them, and acknowledged that he had accidentally
met with an imperfect engraving of a leaf-skeleton in the Museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
of Wormius, which had at one time occasioned much
<span class="locked">wonder<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></span>. It is not improbable that he knew how the Italian,
whom he does not mention, though he is mentioned by Wormius,
and though he must certainly have been acquainted
with his Zootomia, prepared his skeletons. I must however
observe, that it is remarked by those who knew Ruysch, that
he had read few books, and was very little versed in the literature
of his profession.</p>

<p>In the year following, Ruysch described more articles of
the like kind, and gave figures of some pears prepared in this
manner. In 1726, when Vater, professor at Wittenberg, expressed
great astonishment at the fineness of his works, he
replied, in a letter written in 1727, that he had at first caused
them to be executed by insects, but that he then made them
himself with his <span class="locked">fingers<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></span>. He repeated the same thing also
in 1728, when he described and gave engravings of more of
these curious <span class="locked">objects<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></span>. The progress of this invention is related
in the same manner by Schreiber, in his Life of Ruysch.</p>

<p>When the method of producing these skeletons became
publicly known, they were soon prepared by others; some of
whom made observations, which were contrary to those of
Ruysch. Among these in particular were J. Bapt. Du Hamel,
who, so early as the year 1727, described and illustrated
with elegant engravings the interior construction of a <span class="locked">pear<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></span>;
<span class="locked">Trew<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></span>, in whose possession Keysler saw such skeletons in
1730; P. H. G. <span class="locked">Mohring<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></span>; <span class="locked">Seba<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></span>; Francis <span class="locked">Nicholls<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a></span>, an
Englishman; Professor <span class="locked">Hollmann<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></span> at Göttingen, <span class="locked">Ludwig<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></span>,
<span class="locked">Walther<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></span>, <span class="locked">Gesner<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></span> and others. Nicholls seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the first who split the net of an apple- or a pear-tree leaf into
two equal parts, though Ruysch split a leaf of the opuntia
into three, four, and even five layers, as he himself says.</p>

<p>In the year 1748, Seligmann, an engraver, began to publish,
in folio plates, figures of several leaves which he had reduced
to <span class="locked">skeletons<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></span>. As he thought it impossible to make drawings
sufficiently correct, he took impressions from the leaves
or nets themselves, with red ink, and in a manner which may
be seen described in various books on the arts. Of the
greater part he gave two figures, one of the upper and another
of the under side. He promised also to give figures
of the objects as magnified by a solar microscope; and
two plates were to be delivered monthly. Seligmann however
died soon after, if I am not mistaken; and a lawsuit
took place between his heirs, by which the whole of the
copies printed were arrested, and for this reason the work
was never completed, and is to be found only in a very few
libraries.</p>

<p>Cobres says that eight pages of text, with two black and
twenty-nine red copper-plates, were completed. The copy
which is in the library of our university has only eight pages
of text, consisting partly of a preface by C. Trew, and partly
of an account of the author, printed in Latin and German
opposite to each other. Trew gives a history of the physiology
of plants and of leaf-skeletons; and Seligmann treats on
the methods of preparing the latter. The number of the
plates however is greater than that assigned by Cobres. The
copy which is now before me contains thirty-three plates,
printed in red; and besides these, two plates in black, with
figures of the objects magnified. Of the second plate in red,
there is a duplicate with this title, “Leaves of a bergamot
pear-tree, the fruit of which is mild;” but the figures in
both are not the same; and it appears that the author considered
one of the plates as defective, and therefore gave another.
The leaves represented in the plates are those of the
orange-tree, lemon-tree, shaddock-tree, butcher’s-broom, walnut-tree,
pear-tree, laurel, lime-tree, ivy, medlar, chestnut-tree,
maple-tree, holly, willow, white hawthorn, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I shall take this opportunity of inserting here the history
of the art of raising trees from leaves. The first who made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
this art known was Agostino Mandirola, doctor of theology,
an Italian minorite of the Franciscan order. In a small work
upon Gardening, which, as I think, was printed for the first
time at Vicenza, in duodecimo, in the year 1652, and which
was reprinted afterwards in various places, he gave an account
of his having produced trees from the leaves of the
cedar- and <span class="locked">lemon-tree<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a></span>; but he does not relate this circumstance
as if he considered it to be a great discovery. On the
contrary, he appears rather to think it a matter of very little
importance. His book was soon translated into German; and
his account copied by other writers, such as Böckler<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> and
<span class="locked">Hohberg<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></span>, who were at that time much read. A gardener
of Augsburg, as we are told by Agricola, was the first who
imitated this experiment, and proved the possibility of it to
others. He is said to have tried it with good success in the
garden of count de Wratislau, ambassador at Ratisbon from
the elector of Bohemia.</p>

<p>But never was this experiment so often and so successfully
repeated as in the garden of baron de Munchhausen, at Swobber.
A young tree was obtained there from a leaf of the
<i>Limon a Rivo</i>, which produced fruit the second year. It was
sent to M. Volkamer, at Nuremberg, who caused a drawing
to be made from it, which was afterwards engraved, in order
that it might be published in the third volume of his Hesperides;
but as the author died too early, it was not printed.
The exact drawing, as it was then executed at Nuremberg,
and an account of the whole process employed in the experiment
at Swobber, have been published by the baron de
Munchhausen himself, from authentic papers in his grandfather’s
own <span class="locked">writing<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a></span>.</p>

<p>No one, however, excited so much attention to this circumstance
as the well-known George Andrew Agricola, physician
at Ratisbon, who, with that confidence and prolixity which
were peculiar to him, ventured to assert that trees could be
propagated in the speediest manner by planting the leaves,
after being steeped in a liquor which he had invented; and
for the truth of his assertion he referred to his own <span class="locked">experiments<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Among the naturalists of that period none took
more trouble to examine the possibility of this effect than
<span class="locked">Thummig<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a></span>, who endeavoured to prove that not only leaves
with eyes left to them, could, in well-moistened earth, throw
out roots which would produce a stem, but that leaves also
without eyes would grow up to be trees. Baron Munchhausen,
on the other hand, assures us, that according to the
many experiments made in his garden, one can only expect
young plants from the leaves of those trees which do not bring
forth buds; that experiments made with the leaves of the
lemon-tree had alone succeeded, but never those made with
the leaves of the orange- or lime-tree; and that Agricola and
Thummig had erroneously imagined that the leaves themselves
shot up into trees, their middle fibre (<i>rachis</i>) becoming
the stem, and the collateral fibres the branches. But the leaf
decays as soon as it has resigned all its sap to the young tree,
which is springing up below it.</p>

<p>To conclude: It is probable that the well-known multiplication
of the Indian fig, or <i>Opuntia</i>, gave the first idea of this
experiment; for every joint of that plant, stuck into the earth,
and properly nurtured, throws out roots and grows. As these
joints were commonly considered to be leaves, people tried
whether other leaves would not grow in the like manner.
Luckily, those of the lemon-tree were chosen for this purpose;
and what was expected took place. Thus from a false
hypothesis have new truths often been derived; and thus was
Kepler, by a false and even improbable opinion, led to an assertion,
afterwards confirmed, that the periodical revolutions
of the planets were in proportion to their distance from the
sun. But the raising of trees from leaves was too rashly declared
to be a method that might be generally employed; for
it is certain that it now seldom succeeds.</p>

<p>[Beckmann certainly overrates the value of these plant-skeletons
in assisting the acquirement of a knowledge of the
anatomy of plants. By macerating plants in water, all but
the woody fibres are decomposed by the putrefactive fermentation
which ensues. From an examination of these, a knowledge
of structure merely is attainable, which may be now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
truly said to be thoroughly understood. It gives us no insight
into its functions. The modern microscope has revealed
to us the structure of all the components of vegetable tissues,
and has most materially assisted in developing the functions
of several; many, however, remain in the hands of the physiologist.
Nevertheless, these plant-skeletons exhibit the true
course and arrangement of the woody fibres, and form most
beautiful objects. The leaves are not the only parts which
can be thus prepared; the petals of many plants are even more
delicate and beautiful in their ligneous structure, as evidenced
in the hydrangea and several others. Their preparation is
exceedingly simple, but tedious, and can only be well effected
by maceration in water, which frequently requires to
be considerably prolonged. The pulpy half-decomposed portions
are gradually removed by a camel-hair pencil, or other
means, with great delicacy and care; they are finally washed
and bleached, if necessary, with chloride of lime or soda. By
washing in considerably diluted muriatic acid and water, all
traces of this reagent are removed; they are then dried, and
will keep for an indefinite period.]</p>

<h2 id="bills">BILLS OF EXCHANGE.</h2>

<p>I shall not here repeat what has been collected by many
learned men respecting the important history of this noble
invention, but only lay before my readers an ordinance of the
year 1394, concerning the acceptance of bills of exchange,
and also two bills of the year 1404, as they may serve to illustrate
further what has been before said on the subject by
others. These documents are, indeed, more modern than
those found by Raphael de <span class="locked">Turre<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></span> in the writings of the
jurist <span class="locked">Baldus<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></span>, which are dated March 9, 1328; but they are
attended with such circumstances as sufficiently prove that
the method of transacting business by bills of exchange was
fully established so early as the fourteenth century; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the present form and terms were even then used. For this
important information I am indebted to Von Martens, who
found it in a History, written in Spanish, of the maritime
trade and other branches of commerce at Barcelona, taken
entirely from the archives of that city, and accompanied with
documents from the same source, which abound with matter
highly <span class="locked">interesting<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></span>.</p>

<p>Among these is an ordinance issued by the city of Barcelona
in the year 1394, that bills of exchange should be accepted
within twenty-four hours after they were presented;
and that the acceptance should be written on the back of the
<span class="locked">bill<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1404, the magistrates of Bruges, in Flanders,
requested the magistrates of Barcelona to inform them what
was the common practice, in regard to bills of exchange,
when the person who presented a bill raised money on it in
an unusual manner, in the case of its not being paid, and by
these means increased the expenses so much that the drawer
would not consent to sustain the loss. The bill which gave
occasion to this question is inserted in the memorial. It is
written in the short form still used, which certainly seems to
imply great antiquity. It speaks of usance; and it appears
that first and second bills were at that time drawn, and that
when bills were not accepted, it was customary to protest
them.</p>

<p>[It may not, perhaps, be uninteresting to the reader to give
a short account of the present mode of conducting transactions
of bills of exchange; this we condense from Waterston’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Encyclopædia of Commerce, which contains the most
recent and practical account.</p>

<p>The individual who issues the bill is called the drawer, the
person to whom it is addressed the drawee, until he consent
to honour the draft or obey the order or bill, by writing his
name on the face of it, after which he is called the acceptor.
The bill may be passed from hand to hand by delivery or <i>indorsation</i>,
and in the latter case the person who makes over
is called the indorser, and the person who receives the indorsee.
The indorser commonly puts his name on the back,
with or without a direction to pay to a particular person.
He who is in legal possession of the bill and the obligation
contained in it, is called the holder or the payee. There is
no particular form for a bill of exchange required by law,
further than that the mandate to pay in money be distinct,
and the person who is to pay, the person who is to receive,
and the time of payment shall be ascertainable beyond a
doubt. By special statute in England, all bills under 20<i>s.</i> are
void; and those between that sum and £5 must be made payable
within twenty-one days after date, contain the name and
description of the payee, and bear date at the time of making.
Bills of exchange must be on a proper stamp.</p>

<p>Bills, though they are of the nature of a “chose in action,”
which is not strictly assignable, may be transferred from hand
to hand or negociated. To allow of this, there must be negotiable
words, as “or order” or “bearer.” The various parties
upon a bill, besides the acceptors, indorsers, drawers and
others, become liable for its payment on failure of the acceptor.</p>

<p>Bills of exchange cease in England to be documents of
debt on the expiration of six years from the time named for
payment.</p>

<p>In foreign bills, the term “usance” is sometimes employed
to express the period of running in foreign bills. It means a
certain time fixed by custom, as between any two places. An
usance between this kingdom and Rotterdam, Hamburg,
Altona, or Paris, or any place in France, is <i>one</i> calendar
month from the date of the bill; an usance between us and
Cadiz, Madrid or Bilboa, <i>two</i>; an usance between us and
Leghorn, Genoa, or Venice, <i>three</i>.]</p>

<h2 id="tin">TIN. TINNING.</h2>

<p>It is generally believed that the metal called at present tin
was known and employed in the arts, not only in the time of
Pliny, but as early as that of Herodotus, Homer, and Moses.
This I will not venture to deny; but I can only admit that it
is probable, or that the great antiquity of this metal cannot
be so fully proved as that of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead,
and quicksilver.</p>

<p>Tin is one of those minerals which hitherto have been
found in quantity only in a few countries, none of which ever
belonged to the Greeks or the <span class="locked">Romans<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></span>, or were visited, at
an early period, by their merchants. As it never occurs in
a native <span class="locked">state<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></span>, the discovery of it supposes some accident
more extraordinary than that of those metals which are commonly,
or at any rate, often found native. I cannot, however,
attach much importance to this circumstance, as the ancients
became acquainted with iron at an early period, though not
so early as with copper. I must also admit that tin might
have been more easily discovered, because it is frequently
found near the surface of the earth; does not require a
strong heat or artificial apparatus for fusing it, and therefore
can be more easily won than copper.</p>

<p>But if tin was known so early as has hitherto been believed,
it must, on account of the circumstance here first
remarked, have been scarce and therefore exceedingly dear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
In this manner the aurichalcum or Corinthian brass, according
to the expression of Plautus, was “auro contra carum.”
The metal of the ancients, however, which is believed to have
been tin, was not so rare and costly. Vessels of it are not
often mentioned, in general; but they never occur among
valuable articles. The circumstance also, that vessels of tin
have never or very seldom been found among Greek or Roman
antiquities, and that when discovered the nature of the
metal has been very doubtful, though tin is not apt to change
from the action of the air, water, or earth, and at any rate
far surpasses in durability copper and lead, ancient articles
made of which are frequently found, appears to me worthy
of attention. It possesses also so many excellent properties,
that it might be expected that the people of every age, to
whom it was known, would have employed it in a great variety
of ways. It recommends itself by its superior silvery
colour; its ready fusion; the ease with which it can be hammered
and twisted; its lightness, and its durability. It is
not soon tarnished; it is still less liable to rust or to become
oxidized; it retains its splendour a long time, and when it is
lost easily recovers it again. It is not so soon attacked by
salts as many other metals; and this till lately has been considered
a proof of its being less pernicious than it possibly
may be. After an accurate investigation, should everything
said by the ancients of their supposed tin be as applicable to
a metallic mixture as to our tin, my assertion, that it is probable,
but by no means certain, that the ancients were acquainted
with our tin, will be fully justified.</p>

<p>The oldest mention of this metal, as generally believed, is
to be found in the sacred scriptures. In the book of Numbers,
chap. xxxi. ver. 22, Moses seems to name all the metals
then known; and, besides gold, silver, brass (properly copper),
iron, and lead, he mentions also <i>bedil</i>, which all commentators
and dictionaries make to be tin. When Ezekiel, chap. xxvii.
ver. 12, gives an account of the commerce of Tyre, he names,
among the commodities, silver, iron, copper, and <i>bedil</i>. In
Zechariah, chap. iv. ver. 10, the plummet of the builder or
architect is said to be made of the <i>bedil</i> stone. In Isaiah,
chap. i. ver. 25, the word occurs in the plural number, and
appears there to denote either scoriæ, or all those inferior
metallic substances which must be separated from the noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
metals. In the old Greek versions of these Hebrew books,
<i>bedil</i> is always translated by <i>cassiteros</i>, except in the passage
of Isaiah, where no metal is mentioned. In Zechariah, the
translator calls the <i>bedil</i> stone <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">τὸν λίθον κασσιτέρινον</span>. There
can hardly be a doubt, that for the purpose here mentioned,
people would employ, not the lighter metal tin, but lead, and
that the plummet was called the lead-stone, because at first a
stone was used.</p>

<p>It seems, however, probable that in the first-quoted passage
<i>bedil</i> is our tin; but must it not appear astonishing that
the Midianites, in the time of Moses, should have possessed
this metal? Is it not possible that the Hebrew word denoted
a metallic mixture or artificial metal, which formerly was an
article of commerce, as our brass is at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></span>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
The Greek translators considered <i>bedil</i> to be what they
called <i>cassiteros</i>; and as the moderns translated this by
<i>stannum</i>, these words have thus found their way into the
Latin, German, and other versions of the Hebrew scriptures,
which therefore can contribute very little towards the history
of this metal. The examination of the word <i>cassiteros</i> would
be of more importance; but before I proceed to it, I shall
make some observations on what the ancients called <i>stannum</i>.</p>

<p>This, at present, is the general name of our tin; and from
it seem to be formed the <i>estain</i> of the French, the <i>tin</i> of the
Low German and English, and the <i>zinn</i> of the High German.
It can, however, be fully proved that the <i>stannum</i> of the ancients
was no peculiar metal; at any rate not our tin, but
rather a mixture of two other metals, which, like our brass,
was made into various articles and employed for different
purposes, on which account a great trade was carried on with
it. This, at least, may with great certainty be concluded
from a well-known passage of <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></span>; though to us, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
we are not fully acquainted with the metallurgic operations
of the ancients, it is not sufficiently intelligible. What I
have been able to collect, however, towards illustrating the
passage, with the assistance of my predecessors, and by comparing
myself the account of the Roman with our works, I
shall here lay before the reader; and perhaps it may induce
others to improve and enlarge it.</p>

<p>But I must first observe, that there can be no doubt that
the <i>nigrum plumbum</i> of the ancients was our lead. This
metal, according to Pliny’s account, they obtained in two
ways. First, from their own lead mines or lead ore, which
immediately on its fusion gave pure or saleable lead. To
comprehend this, it is necessary to know that most kinds of
lead ore contain also silver, and many of them in such quantity
that they might with more propriety be called silver
ores, or rather argentiferous lead ores or plumbiferous silver
ores. Those which contain no silver are so scarce, that I
am ignorant whether any other has yet been found, except
that of Bleyberg, not far from Villach, in Carinthia. As
Villach lead, according to some experiments made on a large
scale, is entirely free from silver, it is well-known, and particularly
useful for assaying.</p>

<p>It may therefore appear singular that the ancients had lead
of this kind in such abundance that Pliny was able to make
of it a particular division. But it is to be observed, that in
ancient times people paid little attention to a small admixture
of silver; and that they were accustomed to separate
this metal only when it was capable, by the old imperfect
process of smelting, to defray the expenses, which certainly
would not be the case, when a quintal of ore contained only
a few ounces, or even a pound of silver. Strabo says this
expressly of some Spanish ores. Such poor ores were then
used merely for lead; and our silver refiners, without doubt,
would separate silver with considerable advantage from the
lead of the ancients. Hence has arisen the common opinion,
that lead and also copper, with which some of the oldest
buildings are covered, had in the course of time become argentiferous.
This is impossible; but it is possible for us to
separate from them the noble metal, which the ancients either
could not do, or did not think it worth the trouble to attempt.</p>

<p>Secondly, the ancients obtained, as we do, a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
lead from argentiferous ores, from which they separated the
silver and revived the lead. The ore was pounded very fine,
or, as we say, stamped; it was then washed and roasted, and
formed into a powder or paste. This was then put into the
furnace, and by the first fusion gave a regulus consisting of
silver and lead, which was called <i>stannum</i>, and was the same
substance as that known to our metallurgists by the name of
<i>werk</i>. If it was required to separate the silver, it was again
fused, not in the first furnace, but in a particular refining
furnace with a hearth of lixiviated ashes. This circumstance
Pliny has not mentioned; perhaps it appeared to him unnecessary;
perhaps he did not fully understand every part of
the process; and were one inclined to say anything in his
defence, modern travels and other works might be quoted,
in which metallurgic operations are described in a manner no
less imperfect. The produce obtained by the second fusion,
called in German <i>treiben</i> or <i>abtreiben</i>, was silver, and besides
that half-vitrified lead, <i>glätte</i>, which in part falls into the
hearth. This substance, called by Pliny <i>galena</i>, a word
which denotes also <i>molybdæna</i><a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a>, was once more fused or revived,
and then gave lead. In this manner were obtained
three different productions, which were all used in commerce,
namely, <i>stannum</i>, <i>argentum</i> and <i>galena</i>, or revived lead,
<i>plumbum nigrum</i>. These Pliny seems to have considered
as component parts of lead ore; but not indeed according to
the present <span class="locked">signification<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Though it must be confessed that this passage of Pliny
cannot be fully understood by any explanation, it proves to
conviction that the <i>stannum</i> of the ancients was neither our
tin nor a peculiar metal, but the <i>werk</i> of our smelting-houses.
This was long ago remarked by those writers who were acquainted
with metallurgy, of whom I shall here mention
<span class="locked">Agricola<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a></span>, <span class="locked">Encelius<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></span>, <span class="locked">Fallopius<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a></span>, <span class="locked">Savot<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a></span>, <span class="locked">Bernia<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Jung<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></span>.</p>

<p>The ancients used, as a peculiar metal, a mixture of gold
and silver, because they were not acquainted with the art of
separating them, and afterwards gave it the name of <i>electrum</i>.
In the like manner they employed <i>werk</i> or <i>stannum</i>, which
was obtained almost in the same manner in the fusion of silver.
In all probability it was employed before people became
acquainted with the art of separating these two metals, and
continued in use through habit, even after a method of separating
them was discovered. If the ore subjected to fusion
was abundant in silver, this mixture approached near to the
noble metals; if poor in silver, it consisted chiefly of lead.
When it consisted of silver and lead only, it was soft and
ductile; but if other metals, difficult of fusion, such as copper,
iron, or zinc, were intermixed, it was harder and more
brittle, and in that case approached nearer to what the German
silver refiners call <i>abzug</i> and <i>abstrich</i>.</p>

<p>That this <i>stannum</i> was employed as an article of commerce,
and that the ancients made of it vessels of various kinds, cannot
be doubted. The <i>vasa stannea</i> however may be considered
as vessels which were covered with tin only in the inside;
for that this was customary I shall prove hereafter. In
general, these <i>vasa stannea</i> are named where mention is made
of saline or oily things, or such as would readily acquire a
taste and smell from other metals, were they boiled or preserved
in them for any length of <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
It has been long ago remarked that most of the Roman
vessels were made of copper, and that these people were acquainted
with the art of tinning or silvering them; but that
tinned vessels have never been found, and silvered ones very
rarely. Hence so many things appear to have been made of
what is called <i>bronze</i>, which is less liable to acquire that dangerous
rust or oxide, known under the name of verdigris,
than pure copper. This bronze is sometimes given out as
Corinthian and sometimes Syracusan brass, as the gold-coloured
coins of the first size were considered to be Corinthian
brass also. But in my opinion, a great and perhaps the
greater part of all these things were made of <i>stannum</i>, properly
so called, which by the admixture of the noble metals,
and some difficult of fusion, was rendered fitter for use than
pure copper. We are told by Suetonius, that the emperor
Vitellius took away all the gold and silver from the temples
and substituted in their stead <i>aurichalcum</i> and <i>stannum</i><a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a>.</p>

<p>Whether the Greeks worked <i>stannum</i>, and under what
name, I do not know: perhaps we ought to class here the
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσιτέρινα</span> of the oldest times, of which I shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p>What I have already said in regard to <i>werk</i> will be rendered
more certain by the circumstance, that even two centuries
ago, vessels of all kinds called <i>halbwerk</i> were made of
it in Germany. This we are told by <span class="locked">Encelius<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></span> as a thing
well-known in his time, which however I should wish to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
further examined. I have searched in vain for this name in
a great many works of the sixteenth century; but I have
long entertained an idea, which I shall take this opportunity
of mentioning:&mdash;Among the oldest church vessels I have
seen some articles which I considered to be <i>vasa stannea</i>, I
mean such as when newly scoured and polished had a silvery
brightness, and when they remained long without being cleaned
acquired a dull gray colour, and a greater weight than
bronze. Those who show these things commonly say that
the method of composing the metal is lost; but that it contains
silver, and according to the assertion of many, even
gold. Such articles deserve, undoubtedly, to be examined
by our chemists.</p>

<p>I shall further remark, on this subject, that the <i>abstrich</i>, as
it is called, which in many respects has a resemblance to
<i>stannum</i>, and contains also lead and silver, but at the same
time metals difficult of fusion, is employed in the arts, and
collected for the use of the <span class="locked">letter-founders<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></span>. For this purpose
it is well-adapted, on account of its hardness and durability;
and in want of it lead must be mixed with regulus of
antimony. At the Lower Harze the workmen began so early
as 1688 to revive this <i>abstrich</i> in particular; and as the lead
thence obtained, on account of its hardness, could not be disposed
of like common lead, it was sold to the letter-founders
at Brunswick, at first at the rate of a hundred weight for two
and a half dollars, and in the year 1689 for three dollars.
But in Schlüter’s time a small quantity of it only was made
annually, because the <i>abstrich</i> could be used with more advantage
for other purposes. This lead, says Schlüter, had
the appearance of bronze, and was so brittle, that a piece of
it broke into fragments when <span class="locked">struck<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Speise</i> also, which is obtained at the blue colour-works,
can be employed in the same manner. Under this term is
understood a metallic mixture deposited during the preparation
of blue glass, and which is composed of various metals
combined with cobalt, but particularly nickel, iron, copper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
arsenic, and perhaps also bismuth. It is hard, brittle, sonorous,
and assumes a good polish, though it is not always of
the same quality in all manufactories. As it contains some
colouring particles, it is in general again added to the glass
residuum. But when I lately paid a visit to the colour-mill
at Carlshafen, M. Birnstein the inspector told me, that the
<i>speise</i> was manufactured at Halle into buttons of every kind.
This probably is the case there in those button-manufactories
established by G. H. Schier, in which buttons of all patterns
are made annually to the value of 30,000 <span class="locked">dollars<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></span>. The ancients,
in my opinion, employed in a similar manner the <i>werk</i>
of their silver smelting-houses.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to examine that metal which the Greeks
named <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span>, or, as Pliny says, <i>Cassiteron</i>, and which he
expressly adds was called by the Latins <i>plumbum candidum</i>
(white lead). I have no new hypothesis to recommend; my
sole object is truth. I wish for certainty, and, when that is
not to be obtained, probability; at the same time, however,
I cannot rest satisfied with the judgement given by the compilers
of dictionaries, and the translators and commentators
of ancient authors, because I firmly believe that they never
made any researches themselves on the subject.</p>

<p>That the ancients were acquainted with our tin as early as
we find the word <i>cassiteros</i> mentioned by them, I am not able
to prove, and I doubt whether it is possible to do so; the
contrary seems to me to be more probable. In my opinion,
it was impossible for the Phœnicians, at so early a period, to
obtain this metal from Portugal, Spain, and England, in such
quantity that it could be spread all over the old world. The
carriage of merchandise was not then so easy. If all the <i>cassiteron</i>
was procured from the north-west parts of Europe, it
appears to me that it must have been much dearer than it
seems to have been in the oldest times, to judge from the information
that has been preserved.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the oldest <i>cassiteron</i> was nothing else than
the <i>stannum</i> of the Romans, the <i>werk</i> of our smelting-houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
that is, a mixture of lead, silver, and some other accidental
metals. That this has not been expressly remarked by any
Greek writer, is to me not at all surprising. The works of
those who might be supposed to have possessed knowledge of
this kind have not been handed down to us. We should not
have known what <i>stannum</i> was, had not the only passage of
Pliny which informs us been preserved. I am as little surprised
that Herodotus should say he did not know where
<i>cassiteron</i> was obtained. How many modern historians are
ignorant of the place from which zinc, bismuth, and tombac
are brought! and however easy it might be for our historians
to acquire knowledge of this kind if they chose, it was in the
same degree difficult for Herodotus, in whose time there were
not works on mineralogy, technology, and commerce, to furnish
such information. At the period when he lived, <i>cassiteron</i>
perhaps was no metallurgic production of any neighbouring
mines, but a foreign commodity, a knowledge of
which, mercantile people endeavoured in those early ages,
much more than is the case in modern times, to conceal, and
which also could be better concealed than at present.</p>

<p>That real tin was afterwards known to the Greeks, I readily
believe; but I find no proof of it, nor can I determine the
time at which they first became acquainted with this metal.
It is not improbable that they considered it only as a variety
of their old <i>cassiteron</i>, or the <i>stannum</i> of the Romans, as the
latter declared both to be a variety of lead. It might be expected
that the Greeks would have given a peculiar name to
the new tin, in order to distinguish it from the old, as the
Romans really did; but this appears not to have been the
case. I think, however, to have remarked that, so early as
the time of Aristotle, real foreign tin was called the Tyrian
or Celtic, because Tyre undoubtedly was, at that period, the
market for this commodity.</p>

<p>According to the conjectural accounts hitherto given, there
is no necessity for believing the word <i>cassiteron</i> to be Phœnician
or Celtic. The Greeks seem to have used it before they
had Phœnician tin; and because they afterwards considered
the Phœnician ware as a kind of their <i>cassiteron</i>, and at the
same time heard of islands from which it was brought, they
named these islands the <i>Cassiterian</i>, as Herodotus has done,
though he expressly says that he did not know where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
were situated. This ancient historian seems to have entertained
nearly the same opinion in regard to the origin of the
name, for he adds, “At any rate the name Eridanus is not
foreign, but originally <span class="locked">Greek<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></span>.” It is, however, very possible
that every thing said of these islands, in the time of Herodotus,
was merely a fabrication of the Greek merchants, none
of whom had the least knowledge of the Phœnician trade to
<span class="locked">England<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></span>. In this case the <i>bedil</i> of the Hebrews might be
only <i>stannum</i>, and thus would be removed the wonder of
Michaelis, how the Midianites could have obtained tin so
<span class="locked">early<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></span>. I will not, however, deny that the contrary of what
has been here stated is equally possible. The Greeks might
have obtained real tin at a very early period by trade, and
along with it the foreign name, from which was formed <i>cassiteros</i>.
The art of preparing <i>stannum</i> may not have been
known among them, and therefore under the <i>cassiteron</i> of the
Greeks we must undoubtedly understand tin. In this case
one could comprehend why <i>stannum</i> is not mentioned in the
works of the Greeks; and if the <i>plumbum album</i> of Pliny be
our tin, of which there can be scarcely a doubt, his testimony
that the <i>cassiteron</i> of Homer was the same belongs to this
place.</p>

<p>In regard to the question, which opinion seems the most
probable, I will not enter into any dispute; but I must maintain
that, in regard to the periods of Homer and Herodotus,
no certainty can be obtained. To justify this assertion, I shall
here point out everything I have found relating to <i>cassiteron</i>,
and, as far as possible, in the original words, quoting the different
works in the manner in which all the words for dictionaries
of natural history ought to be arranged.</p>

<p>To this I shall add the following illustration. The name
<i>cassiteron</i> is supposed, in general, to be derived from the
Phœnician or <span class="locked">Chaldaic<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a></span>; but on this point I am not able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
decide. Mela, where he explains the name of the Cassiterian
islands, calls it only <i>plumbum</i>, without the addition of any
epithet, unless it has been lost in transcribing. But Pliny
himself <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a></span>, “Cassiterides dictæ Græcis a fertilitate plumbi.”
It is possible, therefore, that the leaden vessels, which are
often mentioned in the works of the ancients, were in part
tin; but I cannot possibly agree with <span class="locked">Millin<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a></span>, who makes the
<i>cyanos</i> of Homer to be tin. This word evidently denotes
mountain-green, or some species of stone coloured by it,
which in former times, like the lapis lazuli at present, was
employed for making various kinds of ornaments. Besides,
<i>cyanos</i> and <i>cassiteros</i> are mentioned in the <span class="locked">Iliad<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a></span> as two different
<span class="locked">things<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a></span>.</p>

<p>What Pliny says of the colour and weight of those minerals
that produced tin, corresponds exceedingly well with tin
ore, which, as is well known, is among the heaviest of minerals,
though the specific gravity of the metal itself is but small.
It is also true that lead is seldom found without silver; and
tin perhaps has never been found with the latter. What we
read in regard to the obtaining of tin ore, agrees very well
with our washing-works. Even at present the greater part of
the tin ores are found in fragments and washed.</p>

<p>The smelting of this metal, even when all the rules of art
are not employed, is attended with little difficulty, though
Goguet is of a different opinion. As of all metals it melts
easiest in the fire, it requires only a small degree of heat and
no artificial furnace; but as it is readily calcined, and after
repeated reduction loses its malleability, care must be taken
that the reduced metal can immediately flow off; and on that
account our furnaces have an aperture always kept open. It
is probable that the ancients, in their small furnaces, could
easily make a similar arrangement.</p>

<p>Tin at all times must have been dearer than lead, as the
latter was found in abundance, but the former in small quantities.
In England at present tin costs about four times as
much as lead. At Hamburg, in 1794, a pound of English
block tin cost eleven schillings and a half, and tin in bars thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
schillings; but a hundred pounds of English lead were
worth at that time only fourteen marks, and Goslar lead eleven
and a half marks ready money.</p>

<p>That tin melts easier than lead is very true. According to
the latest experiments the former fuses at 442°, whereas lead
requires 612° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer. Both metals can
be fused in paper when it is closely wrapped round them.
Aristotle and Pliny meant to say the same thing of their
paper; and the latter adds that the paper, even when it became
torn, was not burnt. What the first says of melting in
water, some have too inconsiderately declared to be a fable;
but it is not entirely false. Tin, when mixed with lead and
bismuth in certain proportions, is so fusible that it melts in
boiling water, because it requires less heat to be fused than
water does to be brought to a state of ebullition. That the
Celtic tin contained a great deal of lead, appears from the
observation, that when rubbed it made the fingers black; an
effect which would not have been produced by pure tin.</p>

<p>That tin in the time of Pliny was mixed with lead, and in
various proportions, we are told by himself. At that period
a mixture of equal parts tin and lead was called <i>argentarium</i>;
and that of two parts lead and one part tin, <i>tertiarium</i>.
Others mixed the latter composition with an equal quantity
of tin, and named the mixture also <i>argentarium</i>, and this was
commonly used for tinning.</p>

<p>I must, however, acknowledge that the last words of Pliny
I do not fully comprehend. They have not indeed been noticed
by any commentator; but I do not on that account believe
that I am the only person to whom they have been in
part unintelligible. Savot and <span class="locked">Watson<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a></span>, who were undoubtedly
capable of giving some decisive opinion on them, have
purposely left that part, which to me appears obscure, untranslated
and without any explanation. Pliny says, “Improbiores
ad tertiarium additis æquis partibus albi, argentarium
vocant, et eo quæ volunt, incoquunt.” He seems here
to throw out a reproach against those who melted together
equal quantities of <i>tertiarium</i> and pure tin, and then gave it
the name of <i>argentarium</i>, as if it had been of an inferior
quality to the <i>argentarium</i> first named. But equal quantities
of <i>tertiarium</i> and pure tin produced a mixture, in which for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
<i>one</i> part of lead there were <i>two</i> of tin. How then could those
who made this mixture be called <i>improbiores</i>? To answer
this question I shall venture to give my conjecture. Pliny
perhaps meant to say, that tinning properly ought to be done
with pure tin, but that unprincipled artists employed for that
purpose tin mixed with lead. If this be the true meaning, his
reproach was not unfounded. On the same account, because
all tin was then adulterated with lead, Galen gives cautions
against the use of tinned vessels, and advises people to preserve
medicines rather in glass or in golden vessels. But why
does Pliny add, “ideo album nulli rei sine mixtura utile?”
In using these words, it is possible he may have alluded, not
to tinning, but to things cast of tin, which, according to the
ideas of that time or the nature of the tin, if of that metal
alone, would be too brittle. This seems to be said by the
preceding words, to which the <i>ideo</i> refers: “albi natura plus
aridi habet, contraque nigri tota humida est, ideo album....”
I hope the reader will forgive me for entering so deeply into
criticism; but if Pliny’s valuable work is ever to become intelligible,
occasional contributions of this kind must not be
despised.</p>

<p>Of the process employed in tinning in ancient times, we
have no account; but the words of Pliny <i>incoquere</i> and <i>incoctilia</i>
seem almost to denote that it was performed, as in tinning
our iron wares, by immersing the vessels in melted tin.
It appears also to have been done at an early period in a very
perfect manner, both because the tinned articles, as Pliny
says, could scarcely be distinguished from silver, and because
the tinning, as he adds, with an expression of wonder, did not
increase the weight of the vessels. The metal, therefore, was
applied so thin that it could make no perceptible addition to
the weight. This is the case still, when the work has been
skilfully executed; and it affords a remarkable proof of the
astonishing divisibility of metal. Dr. Watson caused a vessel,
the surface of which contained 254 square inches, and which
weighed twenty-six ounces, to be tinned, and found that the
weight was increased only half an ounce; consequently half
an ounce of tin was spread over 254 square inches.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all this dexterity, which must be
allowed to the Romans, they appear to have employed tinning
at any rate for kitchen utensils and household furniture very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
seldom. It is scarcely ever mentioned, and never where one
might expect it, that is to say, in works on cookery and domestic
œconomy, where the authors give directions for preparing
and preserving salt provisions. When they speak of
the choice of vessels, they merely say that new earthen ones
should be employed. Some of the physicians only have had
the foresight to recommend tinned vessels. It does not appear
indeed that the Romans, though copper vessels were in
general use among them, employed any precautions to prevent
them from being injurious to the health. Pliny only
says that a coating of <i>stannum</i> improved the taste of food,
and guarded against verdigris. The former part is to be
thus understood; that the bad taste occasioned by copper
was prevented; but he does not say that the health was secured
by it. The term also <i>incoctilia</i>, usual in the time of Pliny,
is found in his works alone. It is likewise remarkable, that
among the numerous vessels found at Herculaneum, as I
have already remarked, the greater part of them were of copper
or <i>stannum</i>, few of which were silvered, and none tinned.
Had tinning been then as much used as at present, some tinned
vessels must have been found.</p>

<p>I shall further remark, that Pliny ascribes the invention of
tinning to the Gauls; and that he extols in particular the
work of the Bituriges, the old inhabitants of the province of
Berry, and those articles made at Alexia or Alegia, which is
considered to have been Alise in Auxois; that he speaks of
tinning copper and not iron, and that according to his account
not only tin was used for that purpose, but also <i>stannum</i>.
By the passages already quoted, it is proved that in the time
of Homer <i>cassiteron</i> was employed for ornamenting shields
and certain kinds of dresses; but the further illustration of
them I shall leave to others. The shields perhaps were inlaid
with tin; and it is not improbable that threads were then
made of this metal, and used for embroidering. That this
art was at that period known may be readily believed, since
the women of Lapland embroider their dresses, and particularly
their fur cloaks, in so delicate and ingenious a manner,
with tin threads drawn out by themselves, as to excite <span class="locked">astonishment<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
What Pliny says is true, that lead cannot be soldered without
tin, or tin without lead. For this operation a mixture of
both metals, which fuses more readily than each of them
singly, is employed. Instead of oil, mentioned by Pliny,
workmen use at present in this process colophonium, or some
other resin.</p>

<p>That vessels were made of cast tin at an early period is
highly probable; but I do not remember to have seen any of
them in collections of antiquities. I am acquainted only with
two instances of their being found, both of which occurred in
England. In the beginning of the last century some pieces of
tin were discovered in Yorkshire, together with other Roman
<span class="locked">antiquities<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></span>; and in 1756 some tin vessels of Roman workmanship
with Roman inscriptions were dug up in <span class="locked">Cornwall<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a></span>.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the history of the tin trade of the Phœnicians,
the Greeks, the Gauls and the Romans, respecting
which only scanty and doubtful information is to be found in
the works of the ancients, but in those of the moderns a greater
number of hypotheses. The situation even of the Cassiterides
islands cannot with certainty be determined, though it
is supposed in general, and not without probability, that they
were the Scilly islands, which lie at the distance of about
thirty miles from the most western part of the English coast;
that is, the extremity of Cornwall, or, as it is called, the Land’s
End. At the same time we must adopt the opinion of Ortelius,
that under that appellation were included the coasts of
Cornwall and <span class="locked">Devonshire<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a></span>. To those who are on the Scilly
islands, Cornwall, as Borlase remarks, appears to be an island;
and as it is impossible that the Scilly islands, which were
called also <i>Silures</i>, could furnish tin sufficient for the ancient
trade, especially as few and very small traces of old works are
observed in them, it is more probable that the greater part of
the metal was obtained from Cornwall. That the Phœnicians
themselves worked mines there, cannot be proved; it is
rather to be supposed that they procured the metal from the
inhabitants by barter; but, on the other hand, there is reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
to believe, from various antiquities, that the Romans dug up
the ore themselves from the mine, and had works for extracting
the metal.</p>

<p>The island Ictis of Diodorus Siculus, to which the ancient
Britons carried tin, and from which it was conveyed by the
Gallic merchants, is generally considered as the Isle of Wight;
but Borlase remarks very <span class="locked">properly<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></span>, that Ictis, according to
the account of the ancients, must have been much nearer to
the coast of Cornwall. He conjectures therefore, and with
great probability, that this word was the general appellation
of a peninsula, or bay, or a place of depôt for <span class="locked">merchandise<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a></span>.
If the Mictis of Timæus and the Vectis of Pliny are not this
island Ictis, it will be difficult to find them. It is very singular,
that Dionysius, a later writer, and his follower Priscian,
and Avienus, call the <i>Cassiterides</i> islands the <i>Hesperides</i><a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a>.</p>

<p>That the Drangians had tin mines appears to me highly
improbable; Strabo is the only writer who says so, in a few
words; and nothing of the kind is to be found in any other
author. If Drangiana be considered as a part of Persia, to
which that district belongs at present, it is stated by all modern
travellers that tin is not to be found anywhere in the
Persian <span class="locked">empire<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></span>. If we reckon it a part of India, Pliny asserts
that no tin-works were then known in that country. In
his time, this metal was sent thither as an article of commerce,
and was purchased with precious stones and pearls. This
last circumstance has by some been considered as a proof of
the high price of the metal at that period; but he says nothing
further than that tin was among the imports of India
at that time, and that jewels and pearls formed a part of the
exports. It may be said that the inhabitants of the Spanish
colonies in America gave their silver for our linen, but we
cannot thence prove that it bears a high price.</p>

<p>That the word <i>stannum</i>, in the time of Pliny, did not signify
tin but a compounded metal, is as certain as that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
later times it became the common name of tin. Hence arises
the question, Since what time has our tin been known under
the appellation of <i>stannum</i>?</p>

<p>This question, as far as I know, has never yet been examined;
and this, I hope, will be a sufficient excuse if I
should not be able to give an answer completely satisfactory.
The first author in whom I find the Greek word <i>cassiteros</i>
translated by <i>stannum</i> is Avienus, in the free translation of
Dionysius; who, as proved by Wernsdorf, lived about the
middle of the fourth century. The next who translates the
Greek word in the same manner, is Priscian; who, according
to the grounds alleged by Wernsdorf, must have lived in the
beginning of the sixth century.</p>

<p>From what I already know, I suspect that the long and
improper name <i>plumbum candidum</i> began in the fourth century
to be exchanged for <i>stannum</i>; and it is probable that,
at that time, tin was so abundant that it banished the old
<i>stannum</i>, to which it might have a resemblance. In later
centuries, then, <i>stannum</i> always signified tin; and in the
middle ages various words were arbitrarily formed from it
which do not occur in the Latin authors. The <i>stannea tecta</i>,
or roof of the church at Agen, on the Garonne, in Guienne,
described by the ecclesiastical poet <span class="locked">Fortunatus<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></span>, about the
end of the sixth century, consisted undoubtedly of tinned
plates of copper. <i>Stagnare</i> occurs often for tinning, as
<i>stagnator</i> does for a tin-founder. In the thirteenth century,
Henry III. of England gave as a present a <i>stagnarium</i> or a
<i>stannaria</i>, a tin mine or tin work, or as others say, <i>fodina
stanni</i>. In the fourteenth century, there was in England,
under Edward III., a <i>stannaria curia</i>; and in the same century,
besides various other ornaments, <i>lunulæ stanneatæ</i> were
forbidden to the clergy. In a catalogue of the year 1379,
the following articles occur: “tria parva stanna modici valoris
... item unum stannum parvum ... item duo
magna <span class="locked">stanna<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a></span>.”</p>

<p>In regard to the tin trade of the Spaniards, I can unfortunately
say nothing: the tin-works in Spain, we are told, were
abandoned under the government of the Moors. England,
as is generally asserted, enjoyed an exclusive trade in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
metal till the thirteenth century, when the tin mines were
discovered and worked in Bohemia. But the exact time
when this took place I am not able to determine. The Bohemian
works, in all probability, are older than the Saxon;
but it is still more certain that the account given by Hagec,
that they were known so early as the year 798, is entirely
void of <span class="locked">foundation<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></span>.</p>

<p>When the English <span class="locked">writers<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a></span> treat on the history of this
metal, they seldom fail to repeat what has been said on the
subject by Matthew Paris. This Benedictine monk, who
was by birth an Englishman, and died in 1259, relates, in his
History of England, that a Cornish-man having fled to Germany,
on account of a murder, first discovered tin there in
the year 1241. He adds, that the Germans soon after furnished
this metal at so cheap a rate, that they could sell it in
England, on which the price there fell, very much to the loss
of Richard Earl of Cornwall, so well known by his having
been elected king of the <span class="locked">Romans<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></span>. Since Matthew relates
this as an event which took place in his time, it would perhaps
be improper to doubt it; but it still appears strange
that no mention is to be found of this circumstance in the
Bohemian or German Annals. Gmelin also must not have
met with any account of it, else he would have announced it.
Peithner likewise is silent respecting it: on the contrary, he
says that the tin mines in the neighbourhood of the town of
Grauppen were discovered as early as the year 1146, by a
peasant named Wnadec, belonging to the village of Chodicze.
Of the antiquity of the Saxon mines I can give no account:
had any information on that subject existed, it would certainly
have been noticed by Gmelin.</p>

<p>Brusch, who was murdered by two noblemen in 1559,
seems to place the discovery of the tin mines at Schlackenwalde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
which he says are younger than those of Schönfeld,
in the thirteenth or twelfth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></span>. Albertus Magnus,
who died in 1280, says that in his time a great deal of tin
was dug up in various parts of Germany. At present the
principal tin works are at Geyer, Ehrenfriedersdorf and
Altenberg.</p>

<p>The art of tinning plate-iron was invented either in Bohemia
or Germany, and introduced at a later period into
England, France, and other countries. But as the whole
history of the German mines is very defective and uncertain,
the period when this useful and highly profitable branch of
business was begun is not known. Yarranton, an English
writer, of whom I shall speak more hereafter, relates that the
first tinning of this kind was made in Bohemia; that a Catholic
clergyman, who embraced the Lutheran religion,
brought the art, about the year 1620, to Saxony, and that
since that time all Europe has been furnished with tin-plate
from Germany.</p>

<p>This much, however, is certain, that the tinning of iron is
more modern than the tinning of copper. The first articles
made by the bottle-makers were flasks of copper tinned, which
in old times were used in war and on journeys, like the <i>stagnone</i>,
still employed in Spain and Portugal, in which all kinds
of distilled waters are sent from <span class="locked">Malta<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a></span>.</p>

<p>Among the English, who formerly had a monopoly of the
tin trade, and who still possess the best and richest tin mines,
the introduction of this art of employing their native production
did not at first succeed; and this circumstance
afforded Becher a subject for <span class="locked">raillery<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></span>. But about the year
1670, a company sent to Saxony, at their expense, an ingenious
man named Andrew Yarranton, in order to learn the
process of tinning. Having acquired there the necessary
knowledge, he returned to England with some German
workmen, and manufactured tin-plate, which met with general
approbation. Before the company, however, could
carry on business on an extensive scale, a man of some distinction,
having made himself acquainted with Yarranton’s
process, obtained a patent for this art; and the first undertakers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
were obliged to give up their enterprise, which had
cost them a great deal of money, and yet no use was made of
the patent which had been <span class="locked">obtained<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></span>.</p>

<p>About the year 1720, which, on account of the many new
schemes and the deceptive trade carried on in consequence
of them, will ever be memorable in the history of English
folly, among the many <i>bubbles</i>, as they were then called, was
an establishment for making tin-plate; and this was one of
the few speculations of that period which were attended with
advantage. The first manufactory of this kind was established
in Monmouthshire, perhaps at the village of Pontypool, where
tin-plate was at any rate made so early as <span class="locked">1730<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a></span>. In France,
the first experiment to introduce this branch of manufacture
was made under Colbert, who procured workmen, some of
whom were established at Chenesey, in Franche-Comté, and
others at Beaumont-la-Ferriere in the Nivernois. But the
want of skill and proper support rendered this expensive undertaking
fruitless. Some manufactories, however, were
brought to be productive in the last century; the oldest of
which was established at Mansvaux in Alsace, in the year
1726. This was followed, in 1733, by another at Bain in
Lorraine, which obtained its privilege from Duke Francis III.,
and this was confirmed by Stanislaus in <span class="locked">1745<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></span>.</p>

<p>That tin, in modern times, has been brought from the
East Indies to Europe is well-known; but I have never been
so fortunate as to discover when this trade began. It is,
however, known, that at the commencement of the sixteenth
century a good deal of information had been obtained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Europe in regard to East Indian tin. Louis Barthema, who
was then in India, speaks of Malacca <span class="locked">tin<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></span>, as does also F.
Mendez Pinto, who was there in 1537, and Odoard Barbosa
mentions that which was carried from Caranguor to Malacca.
Barbosa wrote in <span class="locked">1516<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></span>. Munster, Mercator, and other old
geographers relate, that before the establishment of the Portuguese
dominion in India, large tin coins were in circulation
in the island of Sumatra.</p>

<p>The greater part of the East-Indian tin comes from Siam,
Malacca, and Banca. In the last-mentioned place, which is
an island near the south-east coast of Sumatra, the mines are
said to have been discovered in 1711. In 1776 there were
ten pits, which were worked by Chinese, on account of the king
of Palimbang. One hundred and twenty-five pounds cost
him only five rix dollars; and for this quantity he received
from the Dutch East-India company, to whose government
he was subject, from thirteen to fifteen dollars. The greater
part went to China, or was used in India; but in the year 1778
the company sent 700,000 pounds to Europe, which was sold
at the rate of a hundred pounds for forty-two florins. Malacca
furnishes yearly about three or four hundred thousand pounds;
but the principal part of it remains in India. In the year
1778 the company sold 100,000 pounds in Amsterdam. A
great deal of tin is sold also in its factory at Siam. All the
tin sold by it at Amsterdam between the years 1775 and 1779
amounted to 2,421,597 pounds.</p>

<p>[Tin occurs native in two forms, as peroxide and as sulphuret
of tin and copper. The last is rare; the former constitutes
the great source of tin, and in its native state mixed with
arsenic, copper, zinc and tungsten, is called tin-stone; but
when occurring in rounded masses, grains, or sand in alluvial
soil, is called stream-tin. The metal reduced from the tin-stone
forms block-tin; whilst that from the stream-tin, and
which is the purest, is called grain-tin.</p>

<p>The annual produce of the tin mines and works of Cornwall
is estimated at 4000 tons, worth from £65 to £80 a ton.
About 30,000 cwt. of unwrought tin are annually exported
from Britain, chiefly to France, Italy and Russia; which is,
exclusive of tin and pewter wares and tin-plates, in declared
value nearly £400,000, sent to the United States, Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Germany, France, the colonies, &amp;c. Moreover, from 10,000
to 30,000 cwt. of Banca and Malay tin are imported for re-exportation
to the continent and the United States.</p>

<p>An important enamel has lately been patented for lining
the interior of cast iron vessels and utensils used in cooking,
chemical operations, &amp;c., which will probably replace tinned
articles in a great degree. To apply the process, the
vessels are cleansed with weak sulphuric acid, then washed
and dipped into a thin paste made with quartz first melted
with borax, felspar and clay free from iron, then reduced to an
impalpable powder, and sufficient water added to form thinnish
paste. The vessels are then powdered inside with a linen
bag, containing a very finely powdered mixture of felspar,
carbonate of soda, borax, and a little oxide of tin. The articles
are then dried and heated in an enamelling furnace. The
coating is very white, bears the action of fire without cracking,
and completely resists acid or alkaline solutions.]</p>

I shall here observe, that it may not be improper, in the history of tin,
to show that it was believed more than two hundred years ago that this

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_505" id="Footnote_505" href="#FNanchor_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> Having requested Professor Tychsen, to whose profound knowledge
of Oriental history, languages, and literature I have been already indebted
for much assistance, to point out the grounds on which <i>bedil</i> is considered
to be our tin, I received the following answer, with permission to
insert it in this place.
</p>
<p>
“<i>Bedil</i>, <span xml:lang="he" lang="he">בדיל</span>, according to the most probable derivation, means <i>the separated</i>.
It may therefore, consistent with etymology, be what Pliny
calls <i>stannum</i>, not tin, but lead from which the silver has not been sufficiently
separated. The passage in Isaiah, chap. i. ver. 25, appears to
afford a confirmation, because the word there is put in the plural, equivalent
to scoriæ, as something separated by fusion.
</p>
<p>
“Others derive <i>bedil</i> from the meaning of the Arabic word <span xml:lang="ar" lang="ar">بدل</span> <i>badal</i>,
that is, <i>substitutum</i>, <i>succedaneum</i>. In this case indeed it might mean tin,
which may be readily confounded with silver.
</p>
<p>
“The questions, why <i>bedil</i> has been translated tin, and how old this explanation
may be, are answered by another: Is <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span> tin? If this
be admitted, the explanation is as old as the Greek version of the seventy
interpreters, who in most passages, Ezekiel, chap. xxii. ver. 18 and 20,
and chap. xxvii. ver. 12, express it by the word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span>. In the last-mentioned
passage, tin and iron have exchanged places. The Targumists
also call it tin; and some, with the Samaritan translation, use the Greek
word, but corrupted into <i>kasteron</i>, <i>kastira</i>. It is also the usual Jewish
explanation, that <i>bedil</i> means tin, as <i>oferet</i> does lead.
</p>
<p>
“In the oldest passage, however, where <i>bedil</i> occurs, that is in Numbers,
chap. xxxi. ver. 22, the Seventy translate it by <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">μόλιβος</span>, lead, and
the Vulgate by <i>plumbum</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>, the Seventy for <i>oferet</i> put <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span>,
and the Vulgate <i>stannum</i>. This, as the oldest explanation which
the Latin translator found already in the Septuagint, is particularly worthy
of notice. According to it, one might take <span xml:lang="he" lang="he">בדיל</span>, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">μόλιβος</span>, <i>stannum</i>,
for the <i>stannum</i> of Pliny, lead with silver; the gradation of the metals
still remains; the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span> of the Seventy may be tin or real lead. It
may have denoted tin and lead together, and perhaps the Seventy placed
here <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span>, in order that they might have one metal more for the
Hebrew <i>oferet</i>. But from this explanation it would follow that Moses
was not acquainted with tin.

“The East has still another name for lead and tin, <span xml:lang="he" lang="he">אנך</span>, <i>anac</i>, which
occurs only in Amos, chap. vii. ver. 7 and 8, but is abundant in the Syriac,
Chaldaic, and Armenian, and comprehends <i>plumbum</i>, <i>nigrum</i>, and
<i>candidum</i>.
</p>
<p>
“In the Persian tin is named <i>kalai</i>, <i>resâs</i>, <i>arziz</i>, which are all of Arabic,
or, like <i>kalai</i>, of Turkish extraction. None of these have any affinity to
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span> and <i>bedil</i>.
</p>
<p>
“As tin is brought from India, it occurred to me whether the oldest
name, like <i>tombak</i>, might not be Malayan. But in the Malayan, <i>tima</i> is
the name for tin and lead. Relandi Dissertat. Miscell. iii. p. 65. It
would indeed be in vain to look for Asiatic etymologies in regard to
<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span>, since, according to the express assertion of Herodotus, the
Greeks did not procure tin from Asia, but from the Cassiterides islands.
The name may be Phœnician; and though Bochart has not ventured to
give any etymology of it, one, in case of necessity, might have been found
equally probable as that which he has given of Britannia. But it appears
to me more probable that the word is of Celtic extraction, because similar
names are found in Britain, such as <i>Cassi</i>, an old British family; <i>Cassivelaunus</i>,
a British leader opposed to Cæsar; <i>Cassibelanus</i>, in all probability,
the same name in the time of Claudius. <i>Cassi-ter</i>, with the Greek
termination <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ος</span>, seems to be a Celtic compound, the meaning of which
might perhaps be found in Pelletier, Bullet, &amp;c.”</p></div>

borrowed from foreign metallurgic works, perhaps from the Spanish, as
was conjectured by Agricola in Bermannus, p. 434. This, at any rate, is

still remain. I have however thought that it might perhaps be
thus understood; that in the process of fusion, as then used, the <i>galena</i>
formed the third part of the weight of the ore or paste, and lead a third
part of the <i>galena</i>; though I doubt whether the products of metallic
works were then so accurately weighed. I shall leave the reader to determine
whether the two explanations of Savot are better. He supposes
either that Pliny gives three ways of obtaining lead, namely, from lead
ore, argentiferous ore, and <i>galena</i>; or that he says that silver forms a
third, lead a third, and slag the remaining third. But if the first opinion
be correct, why did Pliny say “Plumbi origo duplex?”</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="sowing">SOWING-MACHINES.</h2>

<p>That under the terms sowing-machine, <i>semoir</i>, drill-plough,
<i>macchine per seminare</i>, are understood implements by which
the seeds of those plants cultivated on a large scale, and
particularly the different species of corn, can be regularly
deposited in the earth, and at any distance from each other,
at pleasure, is at present generally known. The principal
part of the machine consists of a box, having within it a cylinder
furnished with cogs, which forms the axes of two wheels,
and which, as it revolves, assists the seed put into the box to
escape through holes formed at a proper distance from each
other in the bottom.</p>

<p>At first, these machines were exceedingly simple, and had
only in the fore-part a ploughshare; but afterwards a harrow
was applied behind, so that with such an apparatus one could
plough, sow, and harrow at the same time. It was attended,
however, with the common fault of all very complex machines;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
it was too artificial, too expensive, and too easily deranged.
The greater part, therefore, of those lately made have only a
harrow behind them.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the last century so many machines
of this kind have been invented, that to give a complete catalogue
of them would be difficult. The invention, however,
does not belong either to our period or to the English, who
have hitherto paid the greatest attention to the improvement
and employment of it. I have somewhere read that a proposal
for a machine of this kind occurs in Theophrastus; but
I have not yet been able to discover the passage. I am much
rather inclined, from the information I have hitherto obtained,
to place this invention in the sixteenth century, and to ascribe
the merit of it to the Italians. By our oldest writers on agriculture,
Heresbach, Colerus, Florinus, Hohberg and others,
it is not mentioned.</p>

<p>Joseph Locatelli, of whom, however, very little is known,
is commonly considered as the inventor. That he was a
nobleman of Carinthia, but not a count, as he is called in
Iöcher’s Dictionary of Learned Men, is proved by a small
work consisting of two sheets in quarto, now in my <span class="locked">possession<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a></span>.
It is there stated, that experiments were made with a
machine of this kind by the emperor’s order, at the imperial
palace and market of Laxenburg, in the presence of a commissioner,
named Pietro Bonaventura von Crollolanza, appointed
for that purpose. These experiments succeeded so
well, that a crop of sixty for one was obtained from land not
manured, and subject to frequent inundation. On this account
the emperor rewarded the inventor, and sent him with letters
of recommendation to the king of Spain.</p>

<p>In this small work no date is mentioned but on the title-page;
and if that be correct, the invention must be placed in
the last year of the sixteenth or the first of the seventeenth
century, consequently in the reign of the emperor Rudolphus
II., who had a great fondness for mechanical inventions. This
treatise is certainly the same which, as Reinman says, was
printed in 1690 without any place being mentioned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
according to Haller, at Jena, 1690; but the author of it cannot
have been the inventor, as asserted by Iöcher, who adds,
that the tract in question was printed at Vienna in the year
above-mentioned.</p>

<p>The date 1603, however, can hardly be correct; it ought
rather to be 1693, and in that case the tract might have been
three times printed between that period and 1690. The date
in the title-page of my copy appears properly to have in it a
9, which resembles a zero, only because the compositor used
a type on which the lower part of the figure was broke. That
this conjecture is true, I have, I think, sufficiently proved;
though Munchhausen, Haller, and others read the date 1603.</p>

<p>In the year 1669, John Evelyn gave to the Royal Society
of London a complete description of Locatelli’s <span class="locked">invention<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></span>.
He there says that the inventor went with his machine to
Spain, where he proved the advantage of it by public experiments,
and described them in a Spanish work, dedicated to
Geronimo de Camargo, member of the <i>Consejo real de Castilla</i>,
who was commissioned by the king to make known and promote
the use of this machine, the sale of which was secured
to the inventor at a price fixed in his patent. This Spanish
work, from which Evelyn made an extract, was printed with
the Austrian approbation of Crollolanza, and the date Aug.
1st, 1663. Locatelli must immediately after have gone to
Spain, for it is there stated that his machines were made and
sold in great abundance at Madrid, in 1664. The invention
belongs, therefore, to the year 1663.</p>

<p>This machine was exceedingly simple. The seed-box, the
cylinder of which was furnished with two small wheels, required
only to be hooked or fastened, by means of ropes, to
the stilt of the plough. A figure of it may be found in the
before-mentioned German tract; also in the Philosophical
Transactions, and thence copied into Duhamel’s Traité de la
Culture des <span class="locked">Terres<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
The Italians, however, dispute with Locatelli the honour of
the invention. They assert that one of their countrymen,
named M. Giovanni Cavallina, of Bologna, proposed such a
sowing-machine a century and a half before; and they refer
for a proof to the account preserved by Gio Battista Segni
in his work upon Scarcity. This book I have never seen.
Haller gives the title from Seguier, and says that it was first
printed at Bologna, in 1602; but Zanon states 1605, and says
that this Segni, who is not noticed by Iöcher, was a <i>canonicus
regularis</i><a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a>. Of Cavallina I have not been able to find any
further account; not even in the large and full work of Fantuzzi.
I can therefore give only the description of Segni as
transcribed by <span class="locked">Zanon<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a></span>. From this it appears that the machine
alluded to had also a seed-box with two wheels, and might be
compared to a bolting-mill, but below each hole of the bottom
board there seems to have been an iron funnel, which before
was shaped like a plough-share. The machine, therefore,
seems to have formed as many small furrows as it dropped
grains of corn; and, as far as can be judged, there was in the
bottom only one row of holes. It appears also that each grain
of corn, as soon as it dropped, was covered with earth by the
machine. Whether Locatelli took advantage of this invention,
and gave it out, with some alteration, as his own, cannot be
easily determined.</p>

<p>Soon after Locatelli’s invention another sowing-machine
was proposed at Brescia, by the Jesuit Lana, who seems to
have had no knowledge of the preceding ones; at least he
makes no mention of them. The case with Lana was perhaps
the same as with many ingenious men, who possess great
powers of invention. As they never read, but only think,
they are unacquainted with what others have done before
them, and therefore consider every idea which comes into
their mind as new. He proposed a harrow, the spikes of
which should make holes in the earth, in the same manner as
gardeners do with their bean-planter, and the grains of corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
were to fall into these holes from a box pierced like a sieve,
and placed over the <span class="locked">harrow<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a></span>.</p>

<p>I do not know whether this, at present, could be called a
sowing-machine; but it is not improbable that an apparatus
of this kind would facilitate the planting, or, as it is termed,
setting of wheat, which in modern times has been revived in
England, and particularly in Suffolk. For this purpose holes
are made three inches apart, in rows four inches distant from
each other, with a bean-planter, by men and women. Each
labourer is followed by three children, who throw two or three
grains of seed into each hole. One labourer in a second can
make four holes, and in two or three days plant an acre. For
this he obtained nine shillings, one-half of which was given to
the <span class="locked">children<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a></span>. By these means there is a saving of one-half
the seed; and this defrays the expenses. The wheat also,
when it grows up, is cleaner as well as more beautiful; and
this method, besides, affords employment to a great number of
persons.</p>

<p>However minute and ridiculous this method of planting
may appear to our practical farmers, it is nevertheless true
that it has been found beneficial in Upper <span class="locked">Lusatia<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a></span>.</p>

<p>The objection that corn when planted in this manner may
throw out too many stems, which will not all ripen at the
same time, can be true only when the grains are placed at
too great a distance from each other. The German mode of
farming however is still too remote from horticulture to admit
of our attaching great value to the advantages with which
this method is attended.</p>

<p>I shall here remark, that Sir Francis Bacon says that in his
time, that is, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, attempts
had been made to plant wheat, but being too laborious
it was again abandoned, though he declares it to be undoubtedly
<span class="locked">advantageous<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a></span>. In the most populous districts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
China almost all the corn is set, or it is first sown in forcing-beds,
and then transplanted. The English call the labour
with the sowing-machine <i>drilling</i>, and the planting of wheat
they name <i>dibbling</i>.</p>

<p>[Several sowing-machines have been invented, and patents
taken out for them in late years. As it is very difficult to
give a description of them, and still more so for the reader to
comprehend them without figures, we refer to the Penny
Cyclopædia, art. “Sowing-machine,” for an account of the
more important.]</p>

<h2 id="manganese" title="MANGANESE">MANGANESE<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor smaller">561</a>.</h2>

<p>That the art of glass-making may have arisen from an accident,
such as that mentioned by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></span>, I am ready to admit;
but by what accident were artists made acquainted with the
use of manganese, a mineral the outward appearance of which
seems to announce nothing that could be useful to the glass-maker?
It is not found in such abundance as to allow us to
suppose that it naturally presented itself; nor do we know
that any older application of it may have induced the ancients
to employ and examine it in such a manner that the
present use of it might be accidentally discovered. In general,
it resembles some kinds of iron-stone, which it was considered
to be till a very late period. That iron, however,
colours glass must have been very early remarked; and therefore
it could occur to no one to employ manganese for depriving
<span class="locked">frit<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a></span> of its colour. It produces this decoloration only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
when it is added sparingly, and according to a determinate
proportion; otherwise it gives to the glass a violet colour,
something similar to that of the amethyst.</p>

<p>The application of manganese was certainly taught by accident,
and not by theory. But in regard to the question, why
it frees glass from its dirty colour, it must be admitted, if we
readily acknowledge the truth, that we can offer only hypotheses;
as the old chemists called in the aid of phlogiston,
and the new that of <span class="locked">oxygen<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a></span>. Did a false hypothesis, then,
conduct to this discovery? That this was the case, has been
asserted by old as well as more modern writers, and is no
doubt possible. Thus Kepler, from an erroneous hypothesis
in regard to the revolution of the planets, discovered the ratio
of their motion, according to their distance from the sun;
and such instances may be adduced in favour of hypotheses
which have done more harm than good. But, in my opinion,
in examining the origin of the ancient arts, we ought
not to give credit to any cause assigned for an invention until
no other can be found. In regard to the art in question, I
think I can mention one which, at any rate, has probability
in its favour, and which I shall here submit to the reader’s
decision.</p>

<p>That it was observed at an early period that metallic oxides,
and particularly that of iron, which most frequently occurs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
communicate various colours to glass, has been already
<span class="locked">proved<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></span>. It needs therefore excite no wonder that men
should be induced to make experiments on colouring glass
with various minerals, and especially such as contained iron.
Now, since manganese, as already said, has a great resemblance
to iron-stone, it was also occasionally employed; and
it was soon found that this supposed species of iron-stone,
according as it is used in greater or less quantity, gives to
glass many beautiful shades of a violet, red, and dark brown
colour. As it was necessary that the artist should weigh the
manganese, in order to proportion it to the vitreous mass, according
to the required colour, it is possible that the glass,
when a very small quantity had been added, was found to be
colourless. This observation must have been made with the
greater satisfaction, and more readily turned to advantage,
the higher colourless glass, which approached nearest to rock
crystal, was at that time <span class="locked">esteemed<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></span>.</p>

<p>The period however when this great improvement in one
of the most useful arts was fortunately introduced, cannot
with certainty be determined; but it is very probable that it
was practised in the time of Pliny. Were not this the case,
what should have induced him, more than once, to remark
that the magnet was employed in glass? Under this name
the ancients certainly comprehended manganese; which, in
general, had a resemblance to the magnet, and was considered
as such by Agricola, Kircher, and others, at a more
modern period. <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a></span>, in one passage, speaks of a kind of
magnet which was found in Cantabria, not in veins, but interspersed
or in nuclei; and he adds that he did not know
whether it was useful in glass-making, because no one had
ever tried it. This use of manganese then must at that time
have been very common, since it occurred so readily to a
writer in speaking of a supposed magnet.</p>

<p>Another passage of Pliny has been supposed to allude to
manganese, but in my opinion with much less probability.
It is that where he says <i>Alabandicus</i> flows in the fire, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
fused at the <span class="locked">glass-houses<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></span>. But by that term he seems to
understand a kind of marble, according to the opinion of
Isidorus, by whom the word is repeated. As a calcareous
earth it was perhaps added to promote the fusion of the sand.
Camillus Leonardus, however, considered the <i>Alabandicus</i>
as <span class="locked">manganese<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the ancients employed manganese,
if not for glazing, at any rate for painting their pottery
or earthenware, as soon as they became acquainted at the
glass-houses with its susceptibility of being converted into a
coloured vitreous mass.</p>

<p>But this is far from being proved, though count Caylus,
Genssane and others positively assert that the so-called
Etruscan vases and lamps were painted with the same manganese
that we use for our earthen-ware.</p>

<p>Those who attempt to trace out the history of the arts
must be very cautious not to admit, without sufficient proof,
that what the ancients accomplished was effected by the same
means as those employed by us for the same purpose. This,
in some cases, may be true; but in many others false. Thus,
they made a beautiful kind of blue and red glass, without
being acquainted with our cobalt and mineral purple; and
they performed very long sea voyages without our compass.
It is the duty of the historian either to point out the means
which the ancients employed, whether they were the same or
not as those used at present, or to acknowledge that their
processes are unknown to us. Those who invariably follow
this rule will sometimes discover that, in ancient times, men
were able to accomplish the same objects and to produce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
same effects, by means totally different from those used at
present; and then the question will sometimes arise, Which
of the means, the old or the new, are the cheapest, the most
convenient, and the surest? This leads to technological
problems, the solution of which, notwithstanding the great
superiority we possess in those auxiliaries of the arts, natural
history, chemistry, &amp;c., is impossible. I have indulged in
these observations, in mentioning the celebrated Caylus, because
I well know that he has often erred in not attending to
them. I acknowledge and respect the service of this eminent
man; but I am convinced that by the boldness of his
assertions he acquired greater confidence and more celebrity
than he deserved.</p>

<p>The colours on the Etruscan vases have a resemblance indeed
to those on our stone-ware, but it is also true that they
might be produced by oxide of iron.</p>

<p>The substances used by the ancient potters can be determined
only by the testimony of the ancients or by experiments;
but the former is not to be found; and the latter
have never been made, though they would not be difficult to
any chemist who might choose to sacrifice a few vessels of
that kind.</p>

<p>The question how the use of manganese was first found
out, occurred even to Pliny; and his opinion on that subject
deserves to be quoted, especially as it was long considered as
true by Albertus Magnus, Caneparius, and many later writers.
To understand it one must know that it was at first believed
that the magnet, as it attracts iron, could attract other bodies
also; and it was conjectured that other minerals might possess
a similar property. Some imagined that they had found
magnets for gold and silver. In the oldest times men had
so erroneous an opinion of the art of glass-making, that they
conceived that glass was obtained from sand, as metal from
its ore; and Pliny thinks that they then conjectured that a
magnet could attract glass as well as it does iron. Now as
manganese, on account of its similarity, was considered to be
a magnet, it was consequently subjected to experiments, which
gave rise to the beneficial discovery that it renders glass
colourless.</p>

<p>This use of it then has been retained through every age to
the present time, and it is mentioned by all those authors who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
have written on glass-making. <span class="locked">Avicenna<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a></span> makes so complete
a distinction between it and the magnet, that he treats
of each in a particular section, though he says nothing of its
employment in the glass-houses; but indeed as a physician
he had no opportunity of doing so. Albertus <span class="locked">Magnus<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></span>,
however, who lived a century later, Roger Bacon, Basilius
Valentine, Camillus Leonardus, Biringoccio, Mercati, Neri
and many others have spoken in the plainest terms of this
application.</p>

<p>It is seen by the words quoted from different authors, that
the name, which as far as I know occurs first in Albertus
Magnus, was written in a great many different ways: <i>magnesia</i>,
<i>magnosia</i>, <i>magnasia</i>, <i>manganensis</i>, <i>mangadesum</i>, and
in French <i>magalaise</i>, <i>méganaise</i>, <i>magnese</i>. One might imagine
that it is derived from magnet, partly on account of the
similarity of the two substances, and partly on account of its
supposed power to attract glass. Besides, its other name
<i>sidera</i> seems to have a reference to the Greek word for iron.
Mercati, however, deduces the term from <i>mangonizare</i>, because
potters besmear their wares with this mineral; but I
suspect that the name was common before that use of the
substance was known. It is to be observed that to this word
various other significations have been given. Sometimes it
seems to denote common iron-stone, and sometimes pyrites.
What the gold-makers understood by it will be best discovered
by consulting the works of their followers. <i>Braunstein</i> also,
the German name, the earliest mention of which occurs perhaps
in the writings of Basilius Valentine, denoted at first
every kind of ferruginous earth employed by the potters for
painting. Thus Schwenkfeld gave the name of <i>Braunstein</i>
and <i>Braunfarbe</i> to a kind of <span class="locked">bloodstone<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></span>.</p>

<p>For a long time the manganese imported from Piedmont
was in Germany accounted the best, and therefore was much
sought after by the artists of Nuremberg. Afterwards, a
kind brought from Perigord, a place in Guyenne, and named
<i>pierre de Périgueux</i>, or <i>lapis petracorius</i>, was highly esteemed.
Wallerius gives this as a peculiar species; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
my opinion he is right. Its distinguishing characters are,
that it resembles a burnt coal or cinder; has a somewhat
shining surface, and on the fracture appears to be finely striped
and a little coloured. A piece which I have in my possession
exhibits all these marks. This species has been mentioned
by very few of the new mineralogists. Germany,
however, for some centuries past has employed its own manganese,
which even in the time of Biringoccio was sent as an
article of commerce to Italy.</p>

<p>[The distinctness of the metal contained in the manganese
of commerce from iron was first proved by the experiments
of Pott in 1740, by Kaim and Winterl in 1770, and by
Scheele and Bergman in 1774. Soon after this the metal
itself was obtained in an isolated state by Gahn, who gave to
it the name of <i>magnesium</i>, which term however was subsequently
applied to the metal contained in magnesia, and the
word <i>manganese</i> has been adopted to designate both the
metal and the black ore. In addition to its application in
the manufacture of glass, it is now very extensively used in
the decomposition of common salt for the production of chlorine
for bleaching. Some salts of the lower oxides of manganese
have lately been used in calico-printing as a source
of brown colours.]</p>

metal used in the manufacture of glass) is simple and clearly understood.
The sand (silica) used in the manufacture of glass frequently contains
iron, which by the heat necessary for the fusion of the glass becomes reduced
to the state of protoxide, giving the glass a greenish or yellowish
colour; also, if any organic substance be present in the materials (and
where sulphate of soda is used, charcoal is added), the glass is not colourless.
When peroxide of manganese is added, it parts with some of its
oxygen, becoming reduced to the protoxide, which remains colourless in
the glass, the protoxide of iron absorbing the oxygen, becomes at the
same time converted into the peroxide, which also imparts no colour to
the glass, which is thus rendered colourless. If more of the peroxide of
manganese be added than the carbon or protoxide of iron can reduce, it
will tinge the glass of an amethyst colour, as stated in the text.]</p></div>

<h2 id="prince">PRINCE RUPERT’S DROPS. LACRYMÆ VITREÆ.</h2>

<p>It is more than probable that these drops, and the singular
property which they possess, have been known at the glass-houses
since time immemorial. All glass, when suddenly
cooled, becomes brittle, and breaks on the least scratch. On
this account, as far back as the history of the art can be
traced, a cooling furnace was always constructed close to the
fusing furnace. A drop of fused glass falling into <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
might easily have given rise to the invention of these drops;
at any rate this might have been the case in rubbing off
what is called the <span class="locked">navel<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></span>. It is however certain that they
were not known to experimental philosophers till the middle
of the seventeenth century. Their withstanding great force
applied at the thick end, and even blows; and on the other
hand, bursting into the finest dust when the smallest fragment
is broken off from the thin end, are properties so peculiar
that they must excite the curiosity of philosophers, and
induce them to examine these effects, especially at a time
when mankind in general exert themselves with the greatest
zeal to become better acquainted with the phænomena of natural
bodies. On this account they have been noticed in
almost every introduction to experimental philosophy. To
determine the time then in which they were first made known,
seems to be attended with little difficulty; but it still remains
doubtful by whom and in what country.</p>

<p>It appears certain that the first experiments were made by
philosophers with these drops in the year 1656. <span class="locked">Monconys<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></span>,
who travelled at that period, was present when such experiments
were made at Paris, before a learned society, which
assembled at the house of Mommor, the well-known patron
of Gassendi; and the same year he saw similar experiments
made by several scientific persons at London. He tells us
expressly that Chanut, the Swedish resident, procured glass
drops for the first Parisian experiments, and that these drops
were brought from Holland.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that the first glass drops were made
in Holland; yet Montanari, who was professor of mathematics
at Bologna, says that the first were not made by the Dutch,
but by the Swedes. The grounds, however, on which he rests
his assertion are exceedingly weak. Because a Swedish resident
procured those used for the first experiments, it does
not follow that they were made at Swedish glass-houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
especially as it is positively said that they were brought from
Holland. It was indeed stated so early as 1661, by Henry
Regius or Van Roy, professor at Utrecht, that these glass
drops came from Sweden; but may not this have been a lapse
of memory, occasioned by the circumstance that the first drops
used by the natural philosophers of Paris were procured by
a Swedish resident.</p>

<p>Monconys, whose relation indeed bears evident marks of
great haste as well as credulity, calls Chanut <i>Résident de
Suède</i>, and seems to have considered him as a Swedish resident
at the French court; an opinion in which he has been
followed by many literary men. But Pierre Chanut was
French resident at Stockholm, and at that time so well-known
that Monconys could hardly be unacquainted with his quality.
He was resident from the year 1645 to 1649; and he was
afterwards envoy for adjusting the disputes between Sweden
and Poland, which were to be settled at Lubec. He is often
mentioned in Puffendorf’s book De Rebus Suecicis, and the
printed account of his missions and negociations contain important
materials towards a history of queen Christina, with
whom he was a great favourite. He superintended the funeral
of Descartes, who was interred with great honour. He
was born in 1601; but with the time of his death I am unacquainted.
He was celebrated as a man of great learning,
and particularly an able mathematician; and it is neither improbable
nor even impossible that he may have sent the first
glass drops to Paris from Sweden; but why does Monconys
add that they were brought from Holland?</p>

<p>It deserves to be mentioned, that about fifteen years before,
that is in 1641, the first glass-houses were established in Sweden,
and in all probability by Germans. It is possible that
when the blowing of glass was first seen, glass drops may
have excited an attention which they had not met with in
Germany, where no one expected anything new in glass-houses,
which were there common and had long been established.
It can nevertheless be proved that they were known
to our glass-blowers at a much earlier period.</p>

<p>In 1695, John Christian Schulenburg, subrector of the cathedral
school of Bremen, published there a German Dissertation
on glass drops and their properties, in which he says
that he was informed by glass-makers worthy of credit, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
these drops had been made more than seventy years before at
the Mecklenburg glass-houses, that is to say, about the year
1625.</p>

<p>Samuel Reyher, professor at Kiel, says that Henry Sievers,
teacher of mathematics in the gymnasium of Hamburg, had
assured him that such glass drops were given to his father by
a glass-maker so early as the year 1637; and that his father
had exhibited them in a company of friends, who were much
astonished at their effects. Reyher adds, that he himself had
seen at Leyden, in 1656, the first of these glass drops, which
had been made at Amsterdam, where he afterwards purchased
some of the same kind; but in 1666 he procured for a very
small sum a great many of them from the glass-houses in the
neighbourhood of Kiel. It is worthy of remark, that <span class="locked">Huet<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></span>,
who paid considerable attention to the history of inventions,
says that the first glass drops, which he had seen also in the
society held at the house of Mommor, were brought to France
from Germany. According to Anthony Le Grand they came
from <span class="locked">Prussia<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a></span>.</p>

<p>The first glass drops were brought to England by the well-known
Prince Rupert, third son of the elector Palatine, Frederic
V., and the princess Elizabeth, daughter of James I.;
and experiments, described by Rupert Moray, were made
with them in 1661 by command of his majesty. This is expressly
stated by <span class="locked">Merret<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></span>; and therefore what some English
writers have supposed, that Prince Rupert himself was the
inventor, is entirely <span class="locked">erroneous<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a></span>. The services which he rendered
to the useful arts were too great and too numerous to
be either lessened or increased by such trifles.</p>

<p>I shall take this opportunity of remarking, that those small
glasses hermetically sealed and containing a drop of water,
which when placed on hot coals burst with a loud report, and
therefore are called in German <i>knallgläser</i>, fulminating glasses,
were known before 1665. Hooke speaks of them in his <span class="locked">Micrographia<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a></span>
printed in that year, and they were mentioned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Reyher in 1669, in his Dissertation already quoted. In Germany
they are made chiefly by Nuremberg artists; one of
the most celebrated of whom was Michael Sigismund Hack.
He learnt the art of glass-blowing in England, and in 1672
returned to Nuremberg, where he was born in <span class="locked">1643<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="fire">FIRE-ENGINES.</h2>

<p>The invention of pumps I shall leave to those who undertake
to write the history of hydraulics, and here only remark that,
on the testimony of <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a></span>, it is in general ascribed to
Ctesibius, on which account they are called <i>machinæ Ctesibicæ</i>;
and that Ctesibius lived at Alexandria in the time of
Ptolemy Philadelphus and Ptolemy Euergetes I., consequently
two centuries before the Christian æra. My present object
extends no further than to state what I know in regard to the
question, At what time were these machines first employed
for extinguishing fires?</p>

<p>For this purpose, however, it was necessary that the pump-work
employed at first only for raising water should undergo
some alteration. To use it for extinguishing fires, it was requisite
that the water should be speedily driven from the
upper aperture as high as possible; whereas for the first purpose,
it is enough if the water be thrown out in sufficient
quantity to be conveyed to the place of its destination. More
additional parts necessary for extinguishing fires would then
be an imperfection; as the power which gives the water a
needless velocity might be employed with more advantage to
raise a greater quantity of it.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is highly probable that Ctesibius had an
idea of converting his pump into a fire-engine, for his scholar,
Hero of Alexandria, speaks expressly of this use, and describes
the construction of a forcing-pump with two <span class="locked">cylinders<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a></span>;
but it is very doubtful whether this application of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
soon became general, and whether this advantageous machine
was known to the ancient Romans. What I have been able
to learn on the subject is as follows.</p>

<p>Pliny the younger, after telling the emperor Trajan, in one
of his letters, that the town of Nicomedia in Bithynia had
been almost entirely destroyed by a fire, adds, that the devastation
had been increased by a violent storm which took
place at the time; by the laziness of the inhabitants, and by
the want of machines or apparatus proper for extinguishing
the <span class="locked">flames<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></span>. The word <i>sipho</i>, which the author here uses,
was certainly the fire-engine of Ctesibius; though some under
this term understand only aqueducts, canals, and pipes for
distributing water throughout the city. I will not deny that
this word may have signified such pipes, particularly on account
of a passage in <span class="locked">Strabo<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a></span>, where he speaks of the subterranean
conduits of Rome, and says that almost all the houses
had cisterns, <i>siphones</i>, or water-pipes, and running streams.
But Pliny at the same time mentions water-buckets, which
may be considered as an appendage absolutely necessary to
a fire-engine. It is also hardly possible to believe that a town,
immediately situated on an arm of the sea, should be destitute
of <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></span>.</p>

<p>I can however produce from a contemporary writer, a strong
proof that Pliny alluded here to a fire-engine, and I do not
find that the passage has been before quoted. Apollodorus,
the architect, who was employed by the emperor Trajan in
constructing the celebrated bridge over the Danube, and
erecting some large works at Rome, and who was put to
death by his successor Adrian, out of revenge for a jeering
answer which he received from him, as we are told by Dio
Cassius, describes in the fragment of his book on warlike
machines, how assistance may be given when the upper part
of a building is on fire, and the machine called <i>sipho</i> is not
at hand. In this case leathern bags filled with water are to
be fastened to long pipes in such a manner, that by pressing
the bags the water may be forced through the pipes to the
place which is in <span class="locked">flames<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a></span>. The <i>sipho</i>, therefore, was a machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
by which water might be easily projected to a considerable
height, to extinguish a place on fire that could not be
reached by any other means.</p>

<p>That in the fourth century at least a fire-engine, properly
so called, was understood under the term <i>sipho</i>, is fully proved
by Hesychius, and also by Isidorus, who lived in the beginning
of the seventh <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></span>. As the latter remarks that such
engines were employed in the East for extinguishing fires,
there is reason to conclude that they were not then used in
the west.</p>

<p>The question still remains, at what time this apparatus for
extinguishing fires was introduced at Rome. From the numerous
ordinances for preventing accidents by fire, and in
regard to extinguishing fires, which occur in the Roman
<span class="locked">laws<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></span>, there is reason to conjecture that this capital was not
unprovided with those useful implements and machines, of
the want of which in a provincial town Pliny complains, and
which he himself had supplied. This conjecture, however, I
am not able to prove; and instances both in ancient and modern
times show that the good police establishments of small
towns are not always to be found in capitals. Antioch and
several other towns were provided with lanterns, which were
wanting even in the proud Rome. But what excites some
doubt is, that fire-engines are never mentioned in the numerous
accounts given of the fires which took place in that city.
At present it is impossible to speak of a misfortune of this
kind without stating whether a sufficient number of engines
were assembled, and what they effected, as Pliny has not
failed to do in his short account of the fire at Nicomedia.</p>

<p>One passage, however, in Ulpian is commonly quoted as a
proof that in his time there were fire-engines at Rome.
Where he enumerates those things which ought to belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
a house when sold, he mentions, besides other articles used
for extinguishing fires, <i>siphones</i><a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a>. But if this word means
here fire-engines, the passage seems to prove too much; for
it must then be admitted that each house had a fire-engine
of its own. These implements therefore must have been
small hand-engines, such as are kept in many houses at present;
and in that case the passage cannot be adduced as a
proof of public engines, such as Pliny regrets the want of at
Nicomedia. But it is much more probable that Ulpian alludes
only to those <i>siphones</i> which, according to the account
of Strabo, were to be found in every house at Rome; that is,
pipes which conveyed water to it for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>From the total want of fire-engines, or the imperfect manner
in which they were constructed, what Seneca says must
have been true, namely, that the height of the houses at
Rome rendered it impossible to extinguish them when on
<span class="locked">fire<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a></span>. That the buildings there were exceedingly high, and
the lanes, the bridges and even the principal streets remarkably
narrow, is <span class="locked">well-known<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></span>. It is supposed by Archenholz
and others, that the houses at Rome were built of such a
height on account of the great heat in that warm climate;
but the chief reason was undoubtedly that assigned by <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a></span>,
which still produces a like effect. For want of room
on the earth, the buildings were extended towards the heavens;
so that at last the greatest height of an edifice was fixed by
law at seventy, and afterwards at sixty feet. In Hamburg,
at present, where ground is dear and daily becoming more
valuable, the greater part of the houses are little less than
sixty feet in height; a few even are seventy; and that it is
thereby rendered difficult, if not impossible, notwithstanding
the perfection of the German engines, to extinguish fires, is
proved by the melancholy instance of Gera, where the houses
are now built lower. With Neubert’s engine, which was tried
at Hamburg in 1769, eight firemen threw eleven and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
cubic feet of water to the height of sixty-two or sixty-three
feet.</p>

<p>In the East engines were employed not only to extinguish
but to produce fires. The Greek fire, invented by Callinicus,
an architect of Heliopolis, a city afterwards named Balbec, in
the year 678, the use of which was continued in the East till
<span class="locked">1291<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></span>, and which was certainly <span class="locked">liquid<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a></span>, was employed in
many different ways; but chiefly on board ship, being thrown
from large fire-engines on the ships of the enemy. Sometimes
this fire was kindled in particular vessels, which might
be called fire-ships, and which were introduced among a
hostile fleet; sometimes it was put into jars and other vessels,
which were thrown at the enemy by means of projectile <span class="locked">machines<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a></span>,
and sometimes it was squirted by the soldiers from
hand-engines; or, as appears, blown through pipes. But the
machines with which this fire was discharged from the fore-part
of ships, could not have been either hand-engines or
such blow-pipes. They were constructed of copper and iron,
and the extremity of them sometimes resembled the open
mouth and jaws of a lion or other animal; they were painted
and even gilded, and it appears that they were capable of
projecting the fire to a great <span class="locked">distance<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a></span>. These machines by
ancient writers are expressly called spouting-engines. John
Cameniata, speaking of the siege of his native city, Thessalonica,
which was taken by the Saracens in the year 904, says
that the enemy threw fire into the wooden works of the besieged,
which was blown into them by means of tubes, and
thrown from other <span class="locked">vessels<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a></span>. This passage, which I do not
find quoted in any of the works that treat on the Greek fire,
proves that the Greeks in the beginning of the tenth century
were no longer the only people acquainted with the art of
preparing this fire, the precursor of our gunpowder. The
emperor Leo, who about the same period wrote his art of war,
recommends such engines, with a metal covering, to be constructed
in the fore-part of <span class="locked">ships<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a></span>, and he twice afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
mentions engines for throwing out Greek <span class="locked">fire<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a></span>. In the East
one may easily have conceived the idea of loading some kind
of pump with the Greek fire; as the use of a forcing-pump
for extinguishing fires was long known there before the invention
of Callinicus.</p>

<p>At what time the towns in Germany were first furnished
with fire-engines I am not able to determine. In my opinion
they had regulations in regard to fires much earlier than
engines; and the former do not seem to be older than the
first half of the sixteenth century. The oldest respecting the
city of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, with which I am acquainted,
is of the year 1460. The first general ordinance respecting
fires in Saxony was issued by Duke George in 1521. The
first for the city of Dresden, which extended also to the whole
country, was dated 1529. In many towns, the first regulations
made by public authority for preventing fires will no
doubt be found in the general regulations in regard to building,
which seem to be somewhat older than the particular
ordinances concerning fires. At Augsburg an express regulation
in regard to building was drawn up and made publicly
known as early as 1447. In turning over old chronicles, it
is remarked that great fires began to occur less frequently in
the sixteenth century; and this is undoubtedly to be ascribed
to the improved mode of <span class="locked">building<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></span>, the precautions enjoined
by governments to prevent fires, and the introduction of apparatus
for extinguishing them. But by the invention of fire-engines,
every thing in this respect was so much changed,
that a complete revision of the regulations in regard to the
extinguishing of fires became necessary; and therefore the
first mention of town fire-engines will in all probability be
found in the new fire ordinances of the sixteenth and following
century.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by Von Stetten, that in the building
accounts of the city of Augsburg, fire-engines are first mentioned
in the year 1518. They are called there <i>instruments
for fires</i>, <i>water syringes</i> useful at fires; and these names seem
to announce that the machine was then in its infancy. At
that time they were made by a goldsmith at Friedberg, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Anthony Blatner, who the same year became a citizen of
Augsburg. From the account added,&mdash;that the wheels and
levers were constructed by a wheelwright, and from the greatness
of the expense,&mdash;there is reason to conclude that these
were not small, simple hand-engines, but large and complex
machines. In that respectable dictionary entitled Maaler’s
Teutschsprach, Zurich, 1561, I find fire-hooks and fire-ladders,
but no instrument similar to a fire-engine.</p>

<p>In the year 1657, the well-known jesuit Caspar Schott was
struck with admiration on seeing at Nuremberg a fire-engine,
which had been made there by John Hautsch. It stood on
a sledge, ten feet long and four feet broad. The water-cistern
was eight feet in length, four in height, and two in width. It
was moved by twenty-eight men, and forced a stream of
water an inch in diameter to the height of eighty <span class="locked">feet<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a></span>; consequently
over the houses. The machine was drawn by two
horses. Hautsch distributed throughout Germany an engraving
of it, with an offer of constructing similar ones at a
moderate price, and teaching the use of them; but he refused
to show the internal construction of it to Schott, who however
readily conjectured it. From what he says of it, one
may easily perceive that the cylinders did not stand in a perpendicular
direction, but lay horizontally in a box, so that
the pistons moved horizontally, and not vertically, as at present.
Upright cylinders therefore seem to belong to the
more modern improvements. Schott adds, that this was not
a new invention, as there were such engines in other towns;
and he himself forty years before, and consequently in 1617,
had seen one, but much smaller, in his native city. He was
born, as is well-known, in 1608, at Königshofen, not far from
Würzburg. George Hautsch also, son of the above artist,
constructed similar engines, and perhaps with improvements,
for <span class="locked">Wagenseil<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a></span> and others have ascribed to him the invention.</p>

<p>The first regulations at Paris respecting fires, as far as is
known, were made to restrain incendiaries, who in the fourteenth
century, under the name of <i>Boutefoux</i>, occasioned
great devastation, not only in the capital, but in the provinces.
This city appears to have obtained fire-engines for the first
time in the year 1699; at any rate the king at that period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
gave an exclusive right to Dumourier Duperrier to construct
those machines called <i>pompes portatives</i>; and he was engaged
at a certain salary to keep in repair seventeen of them, purchased
for Paris, and to procure and to pay the necessary
workmen. In the year 1722 the number of these engines
was increased to thirty, which were distributed in different
quarters of the city; and at that time the contractors received
annually 20,000 livres. The city, however, besides
these thirty royal engines, had a great many others which
belonged to the Hotel de Ville, and with which the Sieur
Duperrier had nothing to <span class="locked">do<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century fire-engines indeed
were still very imperfect. They had neither an air-chamber
nor buckets, and required a great many men to
work them. They consisted merely of a sucking-pump and
forcing-pump united, which projected the water only in spurts,
and with continual interruption. Such machines, on each
movement of the lever, experience a stoppage, during which
no water is thrown out; and because the pipe is fixed, it cannot
convey water to remote places, though it may reach a
fire at no great distance, where there are doors and windows
to afford it a passage. At the same time the workmen are
exposed to danger from the falling of the houses on fire, and
must remove from them to a greater distance. Hautsch,
however, had adapted to his engine a flexible pipe, which
could be turned to any side as might be necessary, but certainly
not an air-chamber, otherwise Schott would have mentioned
it. In the time of Belidor there were no other engines
in France, and the same kind alone were used in England in
1760. Professor Busch at least concludes <span class="locked">so<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a></span>, from the
account then given by Ferguson, who called Newsham’s
engine, which threw the water out in a continued stream, a
new invention. In Germany the oldest engines are of this
kind.</p>

<p>Who first conceived the idea of applying to the fire-engine
an air-chamber, in which the included air, by compressing
the water, forces it out in a continued stream, is not known.
According to a conjecture of Perrault, Vitruvius seems to
speak of a similar construction; but Perrault himself acknowledges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
that the obscure passage in <span class="locked">question<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a></span> might be explained
in another manner. The air-chamber in its action
has a similarity to Hero’s fountain, in which the air compressed
by the water obliges the latter to <span class="locked">ascend<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a></span>.</p>

<p>I can find no older fire-engine constructed with an air-chamber
than that of which Perrault has given a figure and
description. He says it was kept in the king’s library at
Paris, and during fires could project water to a great height;
that it had only one cylinder, and yet threw out the water in
one continued jet. He mentions neither its age nor the inventor;
and I can only add that his book was printed in
1684. The principle of this machine, however, seems to have
been mentioned before by Mariotte, who on this account is
by some considered as the inventor; but he does not appear
to have had any idea of a fire-engine, at least he does not
mention it.</p>

<p>It is certain that the air-chamber, at least in Germany,
came into common use after it was applied by Leupold to
fire-engines, a great number of which he manufactured and
sold. He gave an account of it in a small work, consisting
of four sheets quarto, which was published in 1720, but at
first he kept the construction a secret. The engines which
he sold consisted of a strong copper box closely shut and
well-soldered. They weighed no more than sixteen pounds,
occupied little room, had only one cylinder; and a man with
one of them could force up the water without interruption
to the height of from twenty to thirty feet. About 1725 Du
Fay saw one of Leupold’s engines at Strasburg, and discovered
by conjecture the construction of it, which he made
known in the Transactions of the Academy of Sciences at
Paris for that year. It is very singular that on this occasion
Du Fay says nothing of Mariotte, or of the engine in
the king’s library. Leupold, however, had some time before,
that is in 1724, given a description and figure in his Theatrum
Machinarum <span class="locked">Hydraulicarum<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a></span>, with which undoubtedly
Du Fay was not acquainted.</p>

<p>Another improvement, no less useful, is the leather hose
added to the engine, which can be lengthened or shortened
as necessary, and to which the fire-pipe is applied, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the person who directs the jet of water can approach the fire
with less danger. This invention, it is well known, belongs
to two Dutchmen, both named Jan van der <span class="locked">Heide<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></span>, who were
inspectors of the apparatus for extinguishing fires at Amsterdam.
The first public experiments made with it took place
in 1672; and were attended with so much success, that at a
fire next year, the old engines were used for the last time,
and the new ones introduced in their stead. In 1677, the
inventor obtained an exclusive privilege to make these engines
during the period of twenty-five years. In 1682, engines
on this construction were distributed in sufficient number
throughout the whole city, and the old ones were entirely
laid aside. In 1695 there were in Amsterdam sixty of these
engines, the nearest six of which were to be employed at
every fire. In the course of a few years they were common
throughout all the towns in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>All these circumstances have been related by the inventor
in a particular work; which, on account of the excellent engravings
it contains, is exceedingly <span class="locked">valuable<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a></span>. Of these, the
first seven represent dangerous conflagrations at which the
old engines were used, but produced very little effect. One
of them is the fire which took place in the stadthouse of
Amsterdam in the year 1652. The twelve following plates
represent fires which were extinguished by means of the new
engines, and exhibit, at the same time, the various ways in
which the engines may be employed with advantage. According
to an annexed calculation, the city of Amsterdam
lost by ten fires, when the old apparatus was in use, 1,024,130
florins; but in the following five years, after the introduction
of the new engines, the loss occasioned by forty fires amounted
only to 18,355 florins; so that the yearly saving was ninety-eight
per cent. Of the internal construction of these engines
no description or plates have been given; nor do I remember
to have read a passage in any author from which it can be
concluded that they were furnished with an air-chamber,
though in the patents they were always called <i>spouting-engines</i>,
which threw up one continued jet of water. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
account given even of the nature of the pipe or hose is short
and defective, probably with a view to render it more difficult
to be imitated. It is only said that it was made of leather in
a particular manner; and that, besides being thick, it was
capable of resisting the force of the water.</p>

<p>The conveyer or bringer was invented also about the same
time by these two Dutchmen. This name is given at present
to a box which has on the one side a sucking-pump, and on the
other a forcing-pump. The former serves to raise the water
from a stream, well, or other reservoir, by means of a stiff
leathern pipe, having at the extremity a metal strainer
pierced with holes to prevent the admission of dirt, and which
is kept suspended above the mud by a round piece of cork.
The forcing-pump drives the water thus drawn up through a
leathern pipe into the engine, and renders the laborious conveyance
of water by buckets unnecessary.</p>

<p>At first, indeed, this machine was exceedingly simple. It
consisted only of a leathern pipe screwed to the engine, the
end of which widened into a bag supported near the reservoir,
and kept open by means of a frame, while the labourers
poured water into it from buckets. A pump, however, to
answer this purpose was soon constructed by the Van der
Heides, who named it a <i>snake-pump</i>. By its means they
were able to convey the water from the distance of a thousand
feet; but I can find no account of the manner in which
it was made. From the figure, I am inclined to think that
they used only one cylinder with a lever. Sometimes also
they placed a portable pump in the water, which was thus
drawn into a leathern hose connected with it, and conveyed
to the engine. Every pipe or hose for conveying water in
this manner they called a <i>wasserschlange</i>, water-snake, and
this was not made of leather, like the hose furnished with a
fire-pipe, but of sail-cloth. They announced, however, that
it required a particular preparation, which consisted in making
it water-tight by means of a proper cement. The pipe
also, through which the water is drawn up, must be stiffened
and distended by means of metal rings; otherwise the external
air, on the first stroke of the pump, would compress the pipe,
so that it could admit no water. It is here seen that pipes
made of sail-cloth are not so new an invention as many have
supposed. That our present apparatus for conveying water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
to the fire-engine is much more ingenious, as well as convenient,
must be allowed; but I would strongly recommend
that in all cities there should be pumps, or running wells of
water, to the spout of which pipes having one end screwed to
a fire-engine might be affixed. The Van der Heides, among
the advantages of their invention, stated that this apparatus
rendered it unnecessary to have leathern buckets, which are
expensive, or at any rate lessened their number, as well as
that of the workmen.</p>

<p>From this account, the truth of which cannot be doubted,
one may readily believe that engines with leathern hose
were certainly not invented by Gottfried Fuchs, director of
the fire apparatus at Copenhagen, in the year 1697, as publicly
announced in 1717, with the addition, that this invention
was soon employed both in Holland and at Hamburg.
Fuchs seems only to have made known the Dutch invention
in Denmark, on occasion of the great fire which took place
on the 19th of April 1689, at the Opera-house of Amalienburg,
when the beautiful palace of that name, and more than
350 persons were consumed. At any rate we are told in
history, that, in consequence of this calamity, an improvement
was made in the fire establishment, by new regulations
issued on the 23rd of July 1689, and that engines on the
Dutch construction, which had been used more than twelve
years at Amsterdam, were introduced.</p>

<p>Hose or pipes of this kind for conveying water were however
not entirely unknown to the ancients. At least the
architect Apollodorus says, that to convey water to high
places exposed to fiery darts, the gut of an ox, having a bag
filled with water affixed to it, might be employed; for on
compressing the bag, the water would be forced up through
the gut to the place of its <span class="locked">destination<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a></span>. This was a conveyer
of the simplest kind.</p>

<p>Among the latest proposals for improving the hose is that
of weaving one without a seam. In 1720, some of this kind
were made of hemp at Leipsic, by Beck, a lace-weaver, as we
are told by Leupold, in his before-mentioned work on fire-engines,
which was printed the same year. After this they
were made by Erke, a linen-weaver of Weimar; and at a
later period they were made of linen at Dresden, and also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
<span class="locked">Silesia<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a></span>. In England, Hegner and Ehrliholzer had a manufactory
at Bethnal-green, near London, where they made
water-tight hose without <span class="locked">seams<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a></span>. Some of the same kind are
made by M. Mögling on his estate near Stutgard, on a loom
of his own invention, and are now used in many towns of the
duchy of Wirtemberg. I shall here remark, that Braun had
a loom on which shirts could be wove without a seam, like
those curious works of art sometimes brought from the East
Indies, and of which he has given a full description with an
<span class="locked">engraving<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the last place, I shall observe, that notwithstanding the
belief of the Turks in predestination, fire-engines are in use at
Constantinople, having been introduced by Ibrahim Effendi.</p>

<p>[The fire-engines now in use are made upon the air-chamber
principle above-described. Mr. Braithwaite has
applied steam-power to the working of fire-engines. On this
principle a locomotive and a floating engine have been constructed.
The former was first employed at a fire in the
Argyle Rooms in 1830. It required eighteen minutes to
elapse before the water in the boiler was raised to 212°, and
threw up from thirty to forty tons of water per hour, to a
height of ninety feet. Two others have been constructed by
the same engineer, one of which threw up ninety tons of
water per hour, and one made for the king of Prussia threw
up about 61¾ tons per minute. In the steam floating engine
which lies in the Thames, the machinery either propels the
vessel, or works the pumps as required. The pipes used for
conveying the water from the plugs to the engines are now
constructed of leather, the seams being either sewed up or
fastened with metallic rivets.]</p>

<h2 id="indigo">INDIGO.</h2>

<p>It is more than probable that indigo, so early as the time of
Dioscorides and Pliny, was brought to Europe, and employed
there in dyeing and painting. This I shall endeavour to show;
but under that name must be understood every kind of blue
pigment, separated from plants by fermentation, and converted
into a friable substance by desiccation; for those who
should maintain that real indigo must be made from those
plants named in the botanical system <i>Indigofera tinctoria</i>, would
confine the subject within too narrow limits; as the substance
which our merchants and dyers consider as real indigo is prepared,
in different countries, from so great a number of plants,
that they are not even varieties of the same species.</p>

<p>Before the American colonies were established, all the indigo
employed in Europe came from the East Indies; and
till the discovery of a passage round the Cape of Good Hope,
it was conveyed, like other Indian productions, partly through
the Persian Gulf, and partly by land to Babylon, or through
Arabia and up the Red Sea to Egypt, from which it was
transported to Europe. Considering this long carriage, as the
article was not obtained, according to the Italian expression,
<i>a drittura</i>, that is, in a direct manner, it needs excite no surprise,
that our knowledge, in regard to its real country and
the manner of preparing it, should be exceedingly uncertain
and imperfect. Is it astonishing that articles, always obtained
through Arabia, should be considered as productions of that
country; and that many commodities which were the work
of art, should be given out to be productions of nature? For
more than a hundred years the Dutch purchased from the
Saxons cobalt, and smalt made from it, and sold them again
in India; and the Indians knew as little where and in what
manner the Dutch obtained them, as the Saxons did the people
who were the ultimate purchasers and consumers. The
real nature of indigo was not generally known in Europe till
the Europeans procured it from the first hand; yet long after
that period, and even in the letters-patent obtained on the
23rd of December 1705, by the proprietors of the mines in
the principality of Halberstadt and the county of Reinstein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
indigo was classed among minerals on account of which works
were suffered to be erected; but this only proves the individual
ignorance of the undertakers, and also of their superiors,
when they read what they had written, and confirms the justness
of Ovid’s advice,</p>

</div>

<p>What Dioscorides calls <i>Indicon</i>, and Pliny and Vitruvius
<i>Indicum</i>, I am strongly inclined to believe to have been our
<span class="locked">indigo<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a></span>. It was a blue pigment brought from India, and
used both in painting and in dyeing. When pounded it gave
a black powder, and when suspended in water it produced an
agreeable mixture of blue and purple. It belonged to the
costly dye-stuffs, and was often adulterated by the addition
of earth. On this account, that which was soft without any
roughness, and which resembled an inspissated juice, was
esteemed the best. Pliny <span class="locked">thinks<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a></span> that pure indigo may be
distinguished from that which is adulterated by burning it, as
the former gives an exceedingly beautiful purple flame, and
emits a smell similar to that of sea-water. Both he and Dioscorides
speak of two kinds, one of which adheres to reeds, in
the form of slime or scum thrown up by the sea; the other,
as Dioscorides says, was scraped from the sides of the dye-pans
in the form of a purple-coloured scum; and Pliny expressly
remarks, that it was collected in this manner in the
establishments for dyeing purple. The former relates also,
that <i>Indicum</i> belonged to the astringent medicines; that it
was used for ulcers and inflammations, and that it cleansed
and healed wounds.</p>

<p>This is all, as far as I know, that is to be found in the
works of the ancients respecting <i>Indicum</i>. I have given it at
full length, as accurately as possible, and I have added, in
order that the reader may be better able to compare and
judge, references to the original words of the authors. <i>Indicon</i>,
it is true, occurs in other passages; but it was certainly
different from the one already mentioned. I allude, for example,
to the black <i>Indicon</i> of Arrian and the <i>Indicon</i> of Hippocrates.
Of the former I shall treat in particular hereafter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and in regard to the latter, I refer to the author quoted in
the note <span class="locked">below<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a></span>. It is not at all surprising that these names
should be applied to more Indian commodities, since at present
we give to many kinds of fruit, flowers, fowls and other
things, the appellation of Indian. The ancients, indeed, were
not so careful as to distinguish always, by a proper addition,
the many articles to which they gave the name of <i>Indica</i>;
and they had reason to expect that their contemporaries
would readily comprehend by the connexion, the kind that
was properly meant. Their commentators, however, in later
times have for the most part thought only of one species or
thing, and by these means they have fallen into mistakes
which I shall here endeavour to rectify.</p>

<p>Everything said by the ancients of <i>Indicum</i> seems to agree
perfectly with our indigo. The proper country of this production
is India; that is to say, Gudscharat or Gutscherad,
and Cambaye or Cambaya, from which it seems to have been
brought to Europe since the earliest periods. It is found
mentioned, from time to time, in every century; it is never
spoken of as a new article, and it has always retained its old
name; which seems to be a proof that it has been used and
employed in commerce without interruption.</p>

<p>It is true, as the ancients say, that good indigo, when pulverized,
is of a blackish colour. The tincture, however, is
partly blue and partly purple; but under the latter term we
must understand an agreeable violet, and not, as is often the
case, our scarlet. It is true also that good indigo is soft or
smooth to the <span class="locked">touch<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></span> when pounded; it floats on water, and
at present, as in the time of Pliny, is adulterated and rendered
heavier by the admixture of some earth, which in general,
as appears, is fine pounded <span class="locked">slate<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a></span>. It is further true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
the purity of it can be discovered by burning it. Indigo free
from all foreign bodies leaves but little ash, while that which
is impure leaves a large quantity of earth. Pliny, perhaps,
did not rightly understand this test by fire, and added from
conjecture, what he says in regard to the colour of the flame
and the smell of the smoke, that this proof might not remain
without an explanation. It is, however, possible that those
who considered indigo to be sea-slime, imagined that they
perceived in it a smell of sea-water. A naturalist of modern
times, who refers petrifactions to Noah’s flood, believed that
he could smell sea-water in them after the lapse of so many
thousand years.</p>

<p><i>Indicum</i>, on account of its long carriage by land, must
have been dear, and therefore it was one of those pigments
which the ancient painters, who were often poor slaves, were
not accustomed to keep in any quantity by them, and with
which it was necessary they should be supplied by those for
whom they executed <span class="locked">paintings<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a></span>. Our indigo was also exceedingly
dear till it was cultivated in the West Indies, where
the value of it decreased as long as good land was plentiful and
the price of labour was lessened by the slave-trade.</p>

<p>That indigo, which at present is used only by dyers, should
have been employed also for painting, needs excite no surprise.
It was applied to this purpose till the invention of
painting in oil, and the discovery of Prussian blue, smalt and
other pigments of a superior quality. It is even still used
by landscape-painters to produce a pale gray; but it will not
harmonise with oil. As to the medical properties of indigo,
I can at any rate show that the experiments made with it at
the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth
century fully confirm the high encomium bestowed by Dioscorides
upon his <i>Indicum</i>. There was a time when the former
was much prescribed and recommended. At present
our physicians are acquainted with purer and more powerful
remedies than indigo, the internal use of which, as the fermented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
mass is prepared in copper vessels, must be attended
with suspicion.</p>

<p>That the author, so often mentioned already, was not acquainted
with the preparation of indigo, cannot be denied.
It would, indeed, have been extraordinary had the account
of it reached the Greeks and the Romans undisguised by
fables, added either to answer the purposes of the interested
merchant, or accidentally in the course of its long journey,
in passing through so many countries and languages. It
appears to me, however, that through these it may still be
discovered; and in all probability we should be better
able to form some idea of it were the oldest method of
making indigo still known. In the slime deposited on the
reeds, I think I can remark the first degree of fermentation,
or commencement of putrefaction, without which the pigment
could not be separated. Who knows whether the indigo
plants in the earliest times were not deposited in pits or in
stagnant water, in the same manner as our flax and hemp?
Who knows whether after putrefaction they were not taken
out, and the colouring parts adhering to them washed off and
collected? The quantity indeed obtained by this process
would not be great, and at present a much better method is
employed; but the improvements made in every art have
been gradual. The old inhabitants of the Canary islands
scratched their land with the horns of oxen, because they
were not acquainted with the spade, and far less with the
plough. The above conjecture will appear much more probable,
when it is known that in many parts of India the
plants were formerly placed in large pits; and in Malta,
where indigo was still cultivated in the seventeenth century,
they were put into reservoirs or basins in order to <span class="locked">ferment<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></span>.
If this was usual in the oldest times, it may be easily seen
how fabulous accounts might arise. Indigo was a slime attracted
from the water by a reed, which the indigo plant,
stripped of its bark, was considered to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Dioscorides speaks of another kind of indigo, which was
the dried purple-coloured scum of the dye-pans. My predecessors,
considering this account as an error, which might have
arisen either from conjecture or misconception, or which was
purposely occasioned by merchants, did not think it worthy
of further examination. I cannot, however, refrain from remarking,
that a blue pigment, and even a very fine one, if the
proper preparations had been made for that purpose, might
have been obtained in this manner. It was not indeed indigo,
in the proper sense of the word, but a pigment of a similar
nature. That fine high-priced powder sold, at present, under
the name of blue carmine, is made from the separated scum
of a dye-liquor, in which the finest colouring particles remain
suspended. The scum or flower of a blue <span class="locked">pan<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a></span> which floats
on the surface exhibits a play of many colours; and as among
these the ancient purple is frequently observed, it may therefore
very properly be said to have a purple <span class="locked">colour<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a></span>. In my
opinion, there is no reason to disbelieve Dioscorides, when
he says that in his time a blue pigment named indigo was
made in this manner, especially as it can be proved that the
woad-dyers, at the end of the sixteenth century, separated
from their pans a colouring substance, which they sold instead
of indigo, an article at that time exceedingly <span class="locked">dear<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a></span>. Besides,
we read that in the establishments for dyeing black, the scum
was in like manner collected in old times in the form of a
black pigment, and this practice, as appears, was usual in all
the dye-houses in general. Pliny, who says that this indigo
was made in the purple dye-houses, seems either to have
misunderstood Dioscorides, or to have been too precipitate;
but it is certain that the scum in the purple dye-houses may
have been collected and dried into a purple-coloured carmine.</p>

<p>As the Europeans did not become acquainted with the
nature of indigo till modern times, it needs excite no astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
that the old commentators should have erred in explaining
the passages to which I here allude; and their opinion
can therefore be of little weight in opposition to mine.
Those who have approached nearest to the truth, Sarazen,
Mathioli, Salmasius, &amp;c., speak as if indigo were made from
our woad, which however does not grow in India. Dioscorides
speaks also of woad in a particular section. Marcellus Vergilius
says, that Dioscorides meant indigo is certain; and this
article is so generally known that it is not worth while to
mention it. But he himself seems not to have been acquainted
with it, else he would have amended the erroneous passage
which speaks of <i>Indian stone</i><a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a>. This arose from the ignorance
of the old transcribers, who being unacquainted with
<i>Indicum</i> thought only of <i>gemma Indica</i>, mentioned by <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a></span>.
But Vergilius was right in this, that the purple lake, spoken
of by Pliny, and not by Dioscorides as he believes, can no
longer be produced.</p>

<p>I have long made it a rule, and prescribed it to others, in
explaining any object mentioned by the ancients, never to
admit, without the strongest proofs, that the same article is
denoted by different appellations. This, it is true, has been
often done. By these means the small knowledge we possess
of a thing that occurs under one name only may be increased.
A wider field may thus be opened for conjecture, and more
latitude may be given to the imagination; but at the same
time one may fall into groundless explanations, and hazard
assertions, which, with whatever caution and learning proposed,
will, on closer examination, be found either false or
highly improbable. According to this rule, I have carefully
endeavoured not to suffer myself to be so far misled by the
respectability of my predecessors, as to consider the <i>Indicum</i>
and <i>Indicum nigrum</i> of the ancients to be the same substance.
On further research I find that the latter not only
appears by the epithet to be different from indigo, but that it
is China, or, as the Dutch call it, Indian ink. To prove this,
I must refer to the passage of <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a></span> on which my assertion is
founded; and perhaps the short illustrations added will render
this minuteness less tedious to those who are fond of such
disquisitions. In the passage referred to, Pliny enumerates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
all the materials which in his time were used for black ink.
He therefore mentions two vitriolic substances, a slime or
sediment (<i>salsugo</i>), and a yellow vitriolic earth (called also
<i>misy</i>). Such minerals continued in use as long as men were
unacquainted with the art of lixiviating the salt, and causing
it to crystallize; or in other words, as long as they had no
vitriol-manufactories. He speaks also of lamp-black being
made in huts built for the purpose, which are described by
Vitruvius, and from which the smoke of burning pine-wood
was conveyed into a close apartment. The article was certainly
adulterated, when soot, taken from the baths and other
places where an open fire was maintained with wood of all
kinds, was intermixed with it. It is very remarkable that
black from burnt refuse of grapes, <i>noir de vigne</i>, which at
present our artists, and particularly our copper-plate printers,
consider as the most beautiful black, was made even at that
period. Germany hitherto has obtained the greater part of
this article from Mentz, through Frankfort, and on that account
it is called Frankfort black. Some is made also at
Kitsingen, Markbreit, and Munich. For this purpose the refuse
of the grapes is charred in a close fire, and being then
finely pounded is packed into casks. Pliny observes, that it
was asserted that from this substance one could obtain a black
which might be substituted for indigo. Another pigment
was bone-black, or burnt ivory, which is highly esteemed
even at present. Besides these, continues he, there is obtained
from India what is called <i>Indicum</i>, the preparation of
which I have not yet been able to learn: but a similar pigment
is made from the black scum of the dye-pans, in places
for dyeing black, and another kind is obtained from charred
fir-wood finely pulverized. The cuttle-fish (<i>sepia</i>) likewise
gives a black; but that however has nothing to do with the
present question. He remarks, in the last place, that every
kind of black pigment is improved, or rather the preparation
of it completed, by exposure to the <span class="locked">sun<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a></span>; that is to say, after
gum has been added to that intended for writing, and size to
that destined for painting. But that which was made with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
vinegar was more durable, and could not be easily effaced by
washing. All this is very true. Our ink acquires a superior
quality when exposed to the light of the sun in flat vessels.
That vinegar renders black colours faster, is well known to
our calico-printers; and those who wish to have good ink
must employ in making it the brightest vinegar of beer. It
is equally true, that every black pigment mixed up with gum
or size can be sooner and easier washed out again with <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></span>.</p>

<p>A considerable part of what has hitherto been quoted from
Pliny, may be found also in <span class="locked">Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></span>. The latter, in like
manner, mentions huts for making lamp-black; he speaks
also of ivory-black, and says expressly, that when it is properly
made it not only forms a good colour and excellent ink,
but approaches very near to <i>Indicum</i>.</p>

<p>Now I might here ask, whether it is at all probable that
the learned Pliny and the practical connoisseur of painting,
the architect Vitruvius, could consider and describe our blue
indigo as a pigment which, like lamp-black, could be employed
as a black colour and as ink? Is it credible that Pliny,
if he meant blue indigo in the before-mentioned passage,
would have said that he was not able to learn the preparation
of it, when he expressly describes it, as he believed it to be,
in the course of a few lines further? Would Pliny and Vitruvius,
had they been acquainted with black indigo only,
remark immediately after, that, when costly indigo could not
be obtained, earth saturated with woad, consequently a blue
earth, might be used in its stead? Is not allusion here made
to a blue pigment, as was before to a black one? Is it not
therefore evident, that the name of <i>Indicum</i> was given to a
black and also to a blue pigment brought from India? And
if this be the case, is it not highly probable that the black
<i>Indicum</i> was what we at present call Indian ink, which approaches
so near to the finest ivory-black, and black of wine
lees, that it is often counterfeited by these substances, a preparation
of which is frequently sold as Indian ink to unwary
purchasers? Indian ink is in general use in India, and has
been so in all probability since the earliest ages. In India all
artificial productions are of very great antiquity; and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
I will venture to say, that it is not probable that Indian
ink is a new invention in India, although it may probably have
been improved, and particularly by the Chinese.</p>

<p>To confound the two substances, however, called indigo
(<i>indicum</i>) at that period was not possible, as every painter
and dealer in colours would know that there were two kinds,
a blue and a black. It has, nevertheless, occurred to me,
that in the works of the ancients obscurity may have sometimes
been avoided by the addition of an epithet; and I once
thought I had found in Pliny an instance of this foresight;
that is, where he names all kinds of colours&mdash;<i>purpurissum</i>,
<i>Indicum cæruleum</i>, <i>melinum</i>, <i>auripigmentum</i>, <i>cerussa</i><a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a>. I
conceived that in this passage our indigo was distinguished
from the black <i>indicum</i> by the epithet <i>cæruleum</i>. But my
joy at this discovery was soon damped by Hardouin, who
places between <i>Indicum</i> and <i>cæruleum</i> a comma, which is not
to be found in many of the oldest and best editions. I cannot,
therefore, get rid of this comma; for it is beyond all dispute
that <i>cæruleum</i> was the common appellation of blue copper
ochre, that is, mountain blue. I shall now proceed to examine
whether my observation be true, that the Greeks frequently
used the term black <i>indicum</i>, when they meant to denote the
black, and not the blue.</p>

<p>The term <i>nigrum Indicum</i> occurs in Arrian, Galen, Paulus
Ægineta, and perhaps in the works of other Greek physicians;
and as the Latin writers were acquainted with an <i>Indicum</i>
which dyed black, there is reason to conjecture that this was
the <i>Indicum nigrum</i> of the Greeks, though I should rather be
inclined to translate this appellation by the words Indian
black, in the same manner as we may say Berlin blue, Roman
red, Naples yellow, Brunswick green, Spanish brown, &amp;c.;
or I should as readily translate it Indian ink. Arrian introduces
it along with other Indian wares. I do not indeed find
that he makes any mention of indigo properly so called; but
a complete catalogue of merchandise is not to be expected
from him. <i>Indicum</i>, however, occurs once more in this author;
but in the passage where it is found it is only an epithet
to another article. Speaking of cinnabar, he adds, that he
means that kind called Indian, which is obtained from a tree
in the same manner as gum. I am inclined to think that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
alludes to dragon’s blood, which on account of its colour was
at that time called cinnabar.</p>

<p>Some have conjectured that what in Arrian is named <i>laccos
chromatinos</i> was our indigo, which indeed might be classed
among the lakes, according to the present meaning of that
word. Others understand by it <span class="locked">gum-lac<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></span>. But I am unacquainted
with any proofs that gum-lac was known at so early
a period. I much doubt whether this meaning of the word
lac be so old; and I must confess that the opinion of Salmasius
appears to me highly probable, namely, that Arrian alluded
to a kind of party-coloured garment: for besides the
grounds adduced by Salmasius, it deserves to be remarked,
that in the passage in question different kinds of clothes, and
no other articles are mentioned. Besides, the epithet <i>chromatinos</i>
is applied by the same writer, in the same sense, to
other kinds of clothing. It cannot therefore be said that
Arrian mentions our gum-lac, the origin of which word Salmasius
endeavours to discover.</p>

<p>In the works of Galen, which have not yet been sufficiently
illustrated, I have found <i>Indicum nigrum</i> only four times.
In a place where he speaks of diseases of the <span class="locked">eyes<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></span>, he extols
it on account of its cleansing quality; and says it can be used
for wounds, when there is no inflammation. In another
<span class="locked">place<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a></span>, it occurs in three prescriptions for eye-salves. I have
however endeavoured, but without success, to find in this
excellent writer an explanation of what he calls <i>Indicum</i>;
though he has explained almost all the different articles then
used in the Materia medica. It appears therefore that the
Greeks gave the name of <i>Indicum</i> to our indigo, and also to
Indian black or Indian ink.</p>

<p>It however cannot be denied that, in opposition to this
opinion, considerable doubts arise. Many who think that
the black indigo (<i>nigrum Indicum</i>) of Pliny and Vitruvius
was not ink, but our indigo, remark, that things of a dark
blue or dark violet colour were by the Greeks and the Romans
frequently named black; and therefore that the blue
indigo might in this manner be called <span class="locked">black<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a></span>. But the examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
adduced as proofs are epithets applied by the poets
to dark-coloured flowers. Because nature produces no black
flowers, the poets, who are fond of everything uncommon,
extraordinary, and hyperbolic, call flowers black, when they
are of so dark a tint as to approach nearly to black. Thus
clear and deep water is called black. It is however hardly
credible that painters and dyers, who must establish an accurate
distinction between colours, should have spoken in so
vague a manner. Salmasius suspects that <i>Nil</i> and <i>Nir</i>, the
Arabic names of indigo, have arisen from the Latin word
<i>niger</i>.</p>

<p>The objection, that Paulus Ægineta, the physician, in a
passage where he refers to Dioscorides for the medical virtues
of <i>Indicum</i>, applies to it the epithet black, seems to have
more <span class="locked">weight<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a></span>. It may be added also, that the virtues, in
general, which Galen ascribes to the <i>Indicum nigrum</i>, appear
to be similar to those ascribed by Dioscorides to <i>Indicum</i>;
and the latter in one <span class="locked">place<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a></span>, where he speaks of the
healing of wounds, uses only the expression <i>Indicum</i>, and
not <i>Indicum nigrum</i>. It is particularly worthy of remark,
that Zosimus, the chemist, declares the hyacinth colour of
the ancients, that of woad, and the <i>Indicum nigrum</i>, to be
the <span class="locked">same<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a></span> or similar. But to those who know on how slight
grounds the ancient physicians ascribed medicinal qualities to
many substances, it will not perhaps appear strange, that, in
consequence of the same name, they should ascribe the same
qualities to two different things. It is not improbable that
in cases of external injury, for which the <i>Indicum nigrum</i>
was recommended, indigo and Indian ink might produce as
much or as little effect. I should consider of far greater importance
the opinion of the chemist Zosimus; but unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
his writings have not yet been printed. The period
in which he lived is still uncertain, and it is not known whether
all the chemical manuscripts which bear that name were
written by the same author.</p>

<p>From what has been said, I think it may, at any rate, be
inferred, that in the time of Vitruvius and Pliny, indigo, as
well as Indian ink, was procured from India, and that both
were named <i>Indicum</i>. It is less certain that the Greeks
called indigo <i>Indicum</i>, and Indian ink <i>Indian black</i>. Nay, it
appears that indigo, on account of the very dark blue colour
which it exhibits both when dry and in the state of a saturated
tincture, was often named Indian black. In my opinion,
it is proved also that, in the old dye-houses, the workmen
collected the scum thrown up by the dye-pans, and dried
it into a kind of lake or carmine.</p>

<p>I shall now prove what I have already asserted, that indigo
was at all times used, and continued without interruption to
be imported from India. I shall quote mention made of it
in various centuries; but I am convinced that attentive readers
may find instances where it occurs in many other writers.</p>

<p>The Arabian physicians, it is probable, all speak of indigo;
but it is unfortunate that in this point we must depend upon
very incorrect Latin translations. It appears also that they
often repeat the information of the Greeks, in regard to articles
of the Materia medica, without having been acquainted
with them themselves. Rhases, who lived at the end of the
tenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a></span>, mentions, “Nil, alias Indicum.” Avicenna,
who died in 1036, often speaks of <span class="locked">indigo<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a></span>; but in the margin
of the wretched translation it is remarked, that under the
term <i>Indicum</i>, alum (or much rather green vitriol) is to be
understood. In a passage, however, where he speaks of dyeing
the hair black, he certainly alludes to indigo, which, according
to the translation, produced <i>colorem pavonaceum</i>, or
a violet colour. In the Latin we find “Indicum indum bonum,”
and this awkward expression Salmasius explains by
remarking, that the words in the Arabic are <i>Alusma Alhendia</i>,
that is, Indian woad. In the same place he mentions
<i>Indicum carmenum</i>, a kind of indigo which did not dye so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
much a violet colour as a black, that is to say with the addition
of green vitriol. Carmania, indeed, bordered on Gedrosia,
which is the proper country of indigo, where the best
is still prepared at Guzerat. In the explanation of some
Arabic words, printed in my copy of Avicenna, <i>Indicum</i> is
translated <i>granum Nil</i>. Serapion, about the end of the
eleventh century, mixed together, as appears, every thing
that the Greeks have said in regard to indigo and woad.
Averroes, in the middle of the twelfth century, mentions the
medicinal qualities of indigo as given by the Greeks, and
adds, that it was much used for dyeing.</p>

<p>Muratori gives a treaty, written in Latin, of the year 1193,
between the citizens of Bologna and Ferrara, which contains
a list of those articles subject to pay duty. Among these
occurs <i>indigum</i><a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a>. In the thirteenth century, the celebrated
Marco Polo, who spent twenty-six years in travelling through
Asia, and even some parts of China, relates that he saw indigo,
which the dyers used, made in the kingdom of Coulan
or Coilum; and he describes the process for preparing <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a></span>.
Much curious information in regard to the trade with this
article, in the middle of the fourteenth century, is contained
in the valuable work of Francesco Balducei <span class="locked">Pegolotti<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></span>. We
there find the names of different kinds, such as <i>Indaco di Baldacca
detto buccaddeo</i>, in all probability from Bagdad, a city
which in many old books of travels is called Baldach or Baldac;
also <i>Indaco del Golfo</i>, <i>Indaco di Cipri</i>, <i>Indaco Rifanti</i>.
Indigo, at that time, was imported in hides (<i>cuojo</i>), or in
leather bags (<i>otre</i>), and also in boxes (<i>casse</i>). What this
traveller says in regard to the signs by which its goodness
may be known, is very remarkable. Nicolo Conti, who travelled
through India before the year 1444, mentions <i>endego</i>
among the merchandise of <span class="locked">Camboia<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a></span>. That the expression
<i>color indicus</i> was used in the middle ages to denote blue
mixed with violet, is proved by Du Cange. It appears to
me therefore highly improbable that indigo should not be
known to Rosetti, as Professor Bischof <span class="locked">supposes<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a></span>. In that
important work on dyeing, however, which I mentioned long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
<span class="locked">ago<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a></span>, it occurs several times, and always under the name
<i>endego</i>.</p>

<p>I shall here make one observation, which is of some importance
in the history of dyeing. It is found that in the
middle ages the Jews maintained in the Levant a great many
establishments for dyeing, and were the principal people who
carried on this branch of business. Benjamin the Jew, who
died in 1173, says in his travels, in speaking of some places,
that “a Jew lived there who was a dyer;” or he remarks, in
regard to others, that “most of the Jews followed the occupation
of dyeing.” A scarlet-dyer lived at Tarento, and a
purple-dyer at Thebes. At that period the Jews at Jerusalem
had hired from the king a place particularly well-fitted
for dyeing, on the express condition that no person besides
themselves should be suffered to carry on there the same <span class="locked">business<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a></span>.
I am fully aware that well-founded doubts have been
entertained in regard to the credit which ought to be given
to Benjamin’s narration, and Jewish vanity is everywhere
well-known; but I do not see why he ought not to be believed
in regard to this point; for it may very naturally be
asked, why he should have falsely ascribed this occupation
to his countrymen and no other? He speaks only once of a
Jew glass-maker, a woollen- and a silk-weaver. To this may
be added, that it is frequently stated in various authors, that
the business of dyeing was carried on in Italy by the Jews.
Thus, in the eleventh century, among the branches of revenue
arising to the popes from Benevento, mention is made of
the taxes paid by the Jews on account of their dye-houses.
In the middle ages princes seem to have maintained dye-houses
on their own account. Instances occur of their giving
away, as presents, such establishments with all their <span class="locked">apparatus<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a></span>.
A place of this kind was called <i>tincta</i>, <i>tingta</i>, or
<i>tintoria</i>. This dye regale is to be deduced perhaps from the
old establishments for dyeing purple, which could be formed
only by sovereigns, and not by private individuals. Along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
with these <i>tinctæ</i> the Jews are often mentioned, so that it
appears probable they were employed there as workmen.</p>

<p>There is reason therefore to conjecture that the Jews
learned this art in the East, and that they employed in Italy
the same pigments as were used in the dye-houses of the
Levant. It is not improbable also, that in the room of woad,
which was then cultivated in Italy, they introduced indigo,
a substance richer in colouring matter, or at any rate, rendered
it more common. The Italians were the first people
in Europe who brought this art to a greater degree of perfection,
as they did many others; and it can be proved that
the knowledge of it was thence diffused to other countries.
In the same proportion as this took place, indigo, in my
opinion, banished the native woad, which was neither so
advantageous, nor communicated so beautiful a colour as the
Italians were able to dye with the former. The use of it
became more extended when the productions of the East
Indies were brought to Europe by sea, and particularly after
it could be obtained from America at a much cheaper rate.</p>

<p>The first Portuguese ship, that commanded by Vasco de
Gama, returned from the East Indies in the year 1499, and
was soon followed by several more, all laden with the most
valuable merchandise of the East. I have never yet been
able to find any invoice of the cargoes of these vessels; and,
unfortunately, we have no account of the early trade carried
on by the Portuguese with Indian productions. I have no
means, therefore, of proving that indigo was among the commodities
first imported. Spices, which in consequence of
the general prevalence of luxury, sold at that time exceedingly
dear, together with precious stones, formed, no doubt,
the first articles of trade; but it is not improbable that they
were soon followed by indigo, for all the travellers who about
that period visited India, speak of it as one of the most current
articles.</p>

<p>Barbosa, a Portuguese, who collected there in 1516 valuable
information in regard to geography and trade, who
afterwards accompanied Magelhaens on his voyage round the
world, and perished with him at the island of Zebu, has given
a price-current of the merchandise at Calecut, in which the
value of good indigo at that time is <span class="locked">stated<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></span>. Corsali also, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
his letters written from India in 1516, mentions indigo among
the wares of Camboya. Louis Guicciardini, who wrote first
in 1563, and died in 1589, speaking of the merchandise obtained
by Antwerp from Portugal, mentions <i>anil</i> among that
of the East <span class="locked">Indies<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is however certain that the trading company established
in the Netherlands in 1602, who learned at an early period
the art of rendering indispensably necessary to the Europeans
cottons, tea, sago, and other things of which they could always
hope to find a sufficient supply in India, carried on the greatest
trade with these articles. The first German writers who complain
of indigenous woad being banished by indigo, and those
sovereigns who, by public orders, endeavoured to prevent this
change, ascribe the fault to the Netherlanders. Niska, who
wrote in 1630, says indigo had been introduced into Germany
only thirty years; and an order of the emperor Ferdinand
III., dated 1654, says that it had been imported into
Germany from Holland some years before that period.</p>

<p>That the importation at this time was very great, is
proved by the cargoes of the ships which arrived in Holland
from the East Indies in 1631. The first had 13,539 pounds
of Sirches indigo; the second 82,734 pounds of Guzerat indigo;
the third 66,996 pounds of the same; the fourth 50,795
pounds of Bajano indigo; the fifth 32,251 pounds of Chirches
indigo; the sixth 59,698 pounds of Bejana indigo; and the
seventh 27,532 pounds of Chirches. I have mentioned these
so particularly, as one may thence see the different kinds,
and the places where made. These seven vessels, therefore,
brought to Europe 333,545 pounds, which, at a low valuation,
were worth five tons of gold, or 500,000 dollars. In
the month of April 1633, three ships brought home 4092
<i>kartel</i> of indigo, which were worth 2,046,000 rix-dollars.</p>

<p>The profit attending this trade induced people, soon after
the discovery of America, to manufacture indigo in that
country; and they were the more encouraged to do so by
observing that the native Americans, before they had the
misfortune to become known to the Christians, tinged their
bodies and faces of a blue-violet colour, by means of indigenous
plants, which resembled the indigo plant of Asia.</p>

<p>Whether the two plants are of the same genus, or whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
the American is different from that used in the other quarters
of the globe, has not yet, as far as I can find, been with
certainty <span class="locked">determined<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a></span>. It is however proved, that the assertion
of Raynal and others, that this plant was first conveyed
to the new world from Asia by the Europeans, is entirely
erroneous. It is mentioned by Francis Colon (or Columbus),
in the Life of his <span class="locked">father<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a></span>, among the valuable productions of
the island of Hispaniola or St. Domingo. Francis Hernandes
reckons it among the natural plants of Mexico, and says
that the Americans used it for dyeing their hair black. He
adds, that they made from it a pigment which they named
<i>Mohuitli</i> and <i>Tleuohuilli</i>, the same as the Latins named
<i>cæruleum</i>, and he describes also the method of preparing it.
This is confirmed by Clavigero in his account of Mexico.</p>

<p>This plant therefore must be reckoned among the few
which are indigenous in three-quarters of the globe. It is,
however, highly probable that the Europeans, in the course
of time, introduced a better species or variety into America,
where several kinds are actually cultivated at present.</p>

<p>In the history of the American indigo, I must here leave a
considerable hiatus, which perhaps may be one day filled up
from books of travels and topography. All that I know at
present is, that the first indigo brought to Europe was procured
from Guatimala, consequently from Mexico, and that
this article was supplied at first, and for a long time, by none
of the West India islands but St. Domingo alone.</p>

<p>Krunitz <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a></span>, but on what authority I do not know, that
Lopez de Gomes relates, that in his time a very fine sky-blue
colour was prepared in Hispaniola. If the person here alluded
to be Lopez de Gomara, who accompanied Ferdinand Cortez
as <span class="locked">chaplain<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a></span>, this would be the oldest testimony that could be
expected, and would correspond with the account given by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Labat. But I shall leave the further investigation of this
subject to others, and observe, that the cultivation of indigo
was begun in Carolina in 1747, and according to Anderson,
was encouraged the year following by premiums.</p>

<p>This article, therefore, was brought from both the Indies
to Europe, and recommended itself so much by the superiority
and richness of its dye, by the facility with which it
could be used, and the advantages attending it, that it suddenly
banished from all dye-houses the European woad,
which was cultivated, in particular, in Thuringia in Germany,
in Languedoc in France, and in the neighbourhood of Rieti
in the dominions of the church. At first, a small quantity of
indigo only was added to the woad, by which the latter was
improved; more was afterwards gradually used, and at last
the quantity became so large, that the small admixture of
woad served only to revive the fermentation of the indigo, but
was not capable itself of communicating any colour. It was
soon observed that every yard of cloth could be dyed somewhat
cheaper when indigo was used along with woad, than
when the latter was employed alone, according to the ancient
method. Germany then lost a production by which farmers,
merchants, carriers, and others, acquired great riches.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century people began, in many countries,
to make considerable improvements in dyeing. For this purpose,
new dye-stuffs, both indigenous and foreign, were subjected
to experiment, and trials were made with salts which
had never before been employed. In this manner dyers
sometimes obtained colours which pleased by their novelty
and beauty; but it needs excite no surprise that many new
methods of dyeing did not produce the desired effect. Many
communicated colours which were agreeable to the eye, but
they soon faded; and some rendered the dyed cloth so tender
that it soon rotted on the shopkeepers’ shelves. Governments
conceiving it then necessary to do something for the
security of the purchaser, considered the imperfection of the
art as a premeditated deception; and as it was at that time
supposed that some pigments could give durable and genuine
colours, and others fading or false ones; and also that the
pernicious effects of salts could not be prevented or moderated,
they, in general, prohibited the use of all new materials
from which hurtful consequences had been observed to arise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Legislators are neither almighty, omniscient, nor infallible.
With the best views, and a firm determination to discharge
their duty, they may recommend things hurtful, and prohibit
others that might be attended with advantage. Were
their commands and prohibitions inviolable, insuperable, and
irresistible, they would often confine the progress of the arts
and sciences, and render useful inventions impossible. But
the people, when they have not entirely become machines,
know how to elude, even at great personal hazard, faulty regulations,
and by prohibited ways to obtain greater advantages
than those which formed the object of the orders issued
by their government. This was the case in regard to the art
of dyeing in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>A recess of the diet held in 1577, prohibited, under the severest
penalties, the newly invented pernicious, deceitful, eating,
and corrosive dye called the <i>devil’s dye</i>, for which vitriol
and other eating substances were used instead of woad. This
prohibition was renewed in 1594 and 1603, with the addition
of this remark, that, in consequence of the weight of the bad
dyes, a pound of undyed silk for sewing or embroidery
would produce two or three pounds of <span class="locked">dyed<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a></span>.</p>

<p>Allusion seems to be made here to black, which at that
time was the colour of the higher orders. It appears that at
this period astringent juices and green vitriol began to be
used more than they had been formerly, and cloth when too
long boiled with these substances, becomes exceedingly tender:
black cloth is even sometimes spoilt in this manner at present.
It is also true that cloth receives the greatest addition in
weight when dyed black, and the next greatest when dyed
blue. I am not acquainted with accurate experiments in regard
to the weight which cloth acquires by dyeing; but one
may safely assert, that it is stated far too high in the recess
of the diet. Fifteen ounces of raw silk lose by that kind of
scouring which the French call <i>décruement</i>, four ounces; consequently
white silk weighs eleven ounces, but after it is dyed
black its weight is increased to thirteen ounces. In general,
a black dye increases the weight of cloth a fifth more than
bright dyes.</p>

<p>As indigo after this soon became common, and the sale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
woad was injured, the first prohibition against the former
was issued by Saxony in the year 1650; and because government
well knew how much depends on a name, when one
wishes to render an object odious or estimable, the prohibition
was couched in terms which seemed to show that indigo
was included among those eating substances, termed in the
recess already mentioned <i>devil’s dyes</i>. In the year 1652, Duke
Ernest the Pious caused a proposal to be made to the diet
by his envoy, Dr. Hœnnen, that indigo should be entirely
banished from the empire, and that an exclusive privilege
should be granted to those who dyed with woad. This was
followed by an imperial prohibition on the 21st of April
1654, in which every thing ordered in regard to the <i>devil’s
dyes</i> is repeated, with this addition, that great care should be
taken to prevent the private introduction of indigo, by which
the trade in woad was lessened, dyed articles injured, and
money carried out of the country. The elector took the
earliest opportunity the same year to make known and enforce
this prohibition with great severity in his <span class="locked">dominions<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a></span>.</p>

<p>The people of Nuremberg, who at that time cultivated
woad, went still further. They made a law that their dyers
should annually take an oath not to use indigo; and at present
they are obliged to do the same thing, though indigo is as
necessary to them as to others; a most indecent disregard to
religion, which, however, is not without example. In the
French monarchy, where all offices were purchased and sold,
every counsellor of parliament, on his entrance, was obliged
to swear that he had not obtained his place by money, until
at length some one had the courage to refuse taking a false
oath. Thus also in Germany many placemen must swear
that they will observe all the orders of government, yet many
of them are daily violated, and indeed cannot be observed, or
at any rate, not without great mischief and confusion.</p>

<p>What was done in Germany in regard to Thuringia, was
done in France in regard to Languedoc. In consequence of
an urgent representation by the states of that province, the
use of indigo was forbidden in 1598; and this prohibition
was afterwards repeated several times. But in the well-known
edict of 1669, in which Colbert separated the fine from the
common dyers, it was stated that indigo should be used without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
woad; and in 1737 dyers were left at liberty to use indigo
alone, or to employ a mixture of indigo and <span class="locked">woad<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></span>.</p>

<p>In England, where, I believe, woad was not at that time
cultivated, the first mention of indigo in the laws occurs in
the year 1581, under the reign of Elizabeth, not, however, on
account of a blue but a black dye. No woollen articles were
to be dyed black with the gall-nut, madder or other materials,
till they had received the first ground, or been rendered blue
by woad, or woad and indigo <span class="locked">together<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a></span>. In like manner it
was long believed that no durable black could be produced
unless the article were first dyed in a blue pan. Hats also
were not considered to be properly dyed unless traces of a
blue tint could be discovered on the place where they were
<span class="locked">cut<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a></span>. At present our dyers can communicate a durable black
without a blue ground, as well as dye a fixed blue without
woad; and in every part of Europe foreign indigo will continue
to be the most common material for dyeing, till its high
price render it necessary to obtain a similar pigment from
indigenous <span class="locked">plants<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a></span>.</p>

<p>[The dye-stuff of indigo is obtained from the plant by
allowing it to ferment with water; during this process it subsides
in the form of a blue deposit, which is collected and
dried. As it occurs in commerce, it contains several impurities,
such as lime, silica, alumina, and oxide of iron, in addition
to the colouring matters, which are three in number, a
brown, red and blue; as also some glutinous matter.</p>

<p>The chief localities of the indigo-plant at present are Bengal
and Guatimala, though of late years the exportation from
the latter has been materially checked by the disturbed state
of Central America. In the early period of our occupation
of India, indigo formed a leading branch of the Company’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
trade; but the rude manufacture of the native population
was in the course of time expelled from the markets of Europe
by the more skilfully prepared drug of America and the West
Indies. Soon after the peace of 1783, the West Indian process
of manufacture was introduced into Bengal, and the directors
having relaxed their prohibitory system so far as to
permit the application of British capital and skill to the cultivation
of the plant on the alluvial depositions of the Ganges,
the exportations were gradually increased, and the American
and West Indian indigo almost entirely driven from the market.
The manufacture was also introduced into Oude and the other
north-western districts of the great plain of the Ganges; and
in later periods into some of the Madras provinces, into Java
and the Philippine Islands. The indigo produced everywhere
else is, however, very secondary both in quantity and quality
to that of Bengal and Bahar, the soil and climate of which
seem to be particularly congenial to the plant. The average
supply of indigo at present may be estimated as follows:&mdash;Bengal
provinces, 34,500 chests, or about 9,000,000 lbs.;
other countries, including Madras and Guatimala, 8500 chests;
total, 43,000 chests. Of this there are consumed in the United
Kingdom, 11,500 chests, or about 3,000,000 lbs.; France, 8000
chests; Germany and the rest of Europe, 13,500 chests; Persia,
3500 chests; India, 2500 chests; United States, 2000 chests;
other countries, 2000 chests; total, 43,000 chests, or upwards
of 11,000,000 lbs. The quantity imported into the United
Kingdom in 1840 amounted to 5,831,269 lbs., and the quantity
entered for home consumption amounted to 3,011,990 lbs.
Upwards of four-fifths of the imports are from the East Indies;
the remainder chiefly from the West Indies, Guatimala, Peru
and the Philippine Islands. The surplus imported beyond
the quantity consumed is re-exported to Germany, Russia,
Italy, Holland and other parts of the continent of Europe.
France and the United States derive their main supplies by
direct importation from Calcutta.]</p>

immediately after calls <i>annulare</i>: “Annulare quod vocant, candidum est,
quo muliebres picturæ illuminantur.” These words I find nowhere explained,
and therefore I shall hazard a conjecture. Pliny, I think, meant
to say that “this was the beautiful white with which the ladies painted

<h2 id="vanes">VANES. WEATHERCOCKS.</h2>

<p>If the poet Seneca was well informed, mankind, in the infancy
of navigation, had no particular names for distinguishing
the principal <span class="locked">winds<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a></span>. This is not at all incredible; because
with their rafts and floats, which were the first vessels, they
for a long time ventured out to sea only so far that they could
easily return to the shore; and therefore while navigation
continued in this state, they had little reason to trouble themselves
about the direction of the winds. It is more certain
that those nations respecting whom we have the oldest information,
distinguished by names the four principal winds
only. This is generally proved by a passage in Homer,
where he intends to mention all the winds, and names only
<span class="locked">four<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></span>; but this proof is of little weight; for what poet at
present would, with the like view, think of boxing the compass,
or of introducing into a poem the names of all the thirty-two
points? Would he not rather be satisfied with the names
of the four chief winds alone? If more names, therefore,
were usual in Homer’s time, he would not consider it necessary
to name them. In another passage he names only two
<span class="locked">winds<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a></span>; and from these some have endeavoured to prove that
no more were then known; but this assertion indeed is completely
refuted by the passage first quoted. It can, however,
be easily proved, that for a long time names were given to
the four principal winds only.</p>

<p>It is easily seen what at first gave rise to this distinction.
The sun at noon stands always over one point of the horizon,
which appears to the observer as a circle, having the place
where he himself is at its centre. This point is called the
meridian or south, and the one opposite to it the north. If
the observer turns his face towards the north, he will have on
his right-hand the east, and on his left the west. The space
between these principal winds contains ninety degrees, or a
right angle. The number, however, must soon have been
raised to eight, and this division was usual in the time of
<span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a></span>. Afterwards twelve points in the heavens were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
adopted, also as many winds; and in the time of Vitruvius
twenty-four were distinguished and named, though this division
was very little used. To determine the names, however,
employed in the last two divisions is attended with some difficulties;
and it almost appears as if writers did not always
apply to them the same meaning.</p>

<p>The Greeks considered Æolus as the first person who made
navigators acquainted with the winds. He is said to have
ruled over the Volcanic islands, afterwards named the Æolian;
and if this be true, he would certainly have a good opportunity
of observing the weather, and marking the winds by the
smoke continually rising up there from burning volcanoes.
This celebrated personage, who received Ulysses on his return
from the Trojan war, by the knowledge thus obtained may
have assisted navigators, who afterwards made known the
services which he rendered to them.</p>

<p>The antiquity of the division into thirty-two points, used
at present, I am not able to determine. Riccioli thinks that
they have been employed since the time of Charles the Great,
but I do not know whether this can be proved. That assertion
perhaps is founded only on the opinion, that this emperor
gave German names to the winds and the quarters of
the world. This indeed is stated by his historian Eginhart,
who mentions the names, which I shall here insert, together
with the Latin names added by Eginhart, and those usual at
<span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></span>.</p>

<p>It has however been long since remarked, that these names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
are much older than Charles the <span class="locked">Great<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a></span>; and it is highly
probable that they were only more accurately defined, or
publicly confirmed by this prince, or that in his time they
came into general use. How often have early inventions
been ascribed to sovereigns, though they were only made in
their reign! Even whole nations have been said to be descended
from those princes under whom they first became
known to foreigners; as, for example, the Poles from Lech,
and the Bohemians from Zech.</p>

<p>Charles, however, did not give names to thirty-two, but to
twelve winds. Nor was he the first who added to the four
cardinal points eight others, for the same thing is asserted of
many. But it deserves to be remarked, that in Charles’s
names one can discover traces of that ingenious mode of denoting
all the winds with four words; that is to say, by different
combinations of East, West, South, and North. It is
certain that the names of the different points and winds used
by all the European nations, the Italians only excepted, are
of German origin, as well as the greater part of the terms of
art employed in navigation and naval architecture.</p>

<p>It appears to me not improbable that the division used at
present was introduced soon after the invention of the magnetic
needle; at least Honorius, surnamed <i>Augustodunensis</i><a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a>,
who must have flourished before the year 1125, speaks only
of twelve winds; as do also Gervasius in 1211, and Vincent
de Beauvois in the middle of the thirteenth century, who
gives from Isidorus, who lived about the year 636, the twelve
Latin names used by <span class="locked">Eginhart<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a></span>.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be doubted that means for indicating the
winds were invented at a very early period. I here allude
to vanes, flags, and every other apparatus by which the direction
of the wind can be conveniently and accurately discovered,
and similar to those erected at present on many private
houses, on most of our church steeples, and on board ships.
I must however confess that I have hitherto scarcely observed
any trace of them among the Greeks and the Romans.
I can find no account of them in works where all the parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
of edifices are named; where ships and everything belonging
to them are expressly described; nothing in Pollux, and
nothing in any of the poets. I am unacquainted also
with any old Greek or Latin word that can be applied
to an apparatus for pointing out the wind. In the edition
of Kirsch’s German and Latin Dictionary, printed in
1754, we find <i>Wetterhahn</i> (a weathercock) <i>petalum</i>, <i>triton</i>;
but the latter term is borrowed from the tower of Andronicus,
of which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter; and
neither this word nor <i>petulum</i>, or <i>petulæ</i>, <i>arum</i>, which Kirsch
gives also, occurs in this sense in any ancient author; and the
case is the same with <i>pinnacella</i>, <i>ventilogium</i>, <i>aurologium</i>,
and other names which are to be found in some dictionaries.</p>

<p>I am acquainted with no older information in regard to an
apparatus for observing the winds, than what is given by Vitruvius
respecting the tower built at Athens by Andronicus
Cyrrhestes, that is, of Cyrrhus, a town in Syria. This tower,
which was built of marble, in an octagonal form, had on each
side a representation of that wind opposite to which it was
placed. Its summit terminated in a small spire, on which
was a copper triton, made to turn in such a manner as to
present its front to the wind, and to point with a rod held in
its right-hand to the image of the wind blowing at the <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a></span>.
This tower is still standing; and a description and figure of
it may be seen in the travels of Spon and Wheeler, and in
those also of <span class="locked">Pocock<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a></span>. The figures representing the winds,
which are larger than the life, are executed in basso-relievo,
and correspond to the seasons at which they generally blow.
At the top of each side, under the architrave, the name of
the wind is inscribed in Greek characters. Boreas, the North
wind, holds in his hand a mussel-shell, which seems to denote
his peculiar power over the sea. The Zephyr has its bosom
full of flowers, because it prevails in March, at the time when
the flowers chiefly blow in Greece; and similar attributes
are assigned to the rest.</p>

<p>Varro had an apparatus of the same kind at his <span class="locked">farm<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Within the building was a circle, in which the eight winds
were represented, and an index, like that of a clock, pointed
to that wind which was blowing at the time. Nothing therefore
was necessary but to look at the ceiling to know from
what quarter the wind came. I have seen an apparatus of
the same kind on some exchange, either at Lubec or Rotterdam.
Varro calls the tower of Andronicus <i>horologium</i>, a
word which Salmasius wishes to change into <i>aurologium</i>.
But it contained also a sun-dial, as we are assured by Pocock,
who observed the necessary hour-lines; and therefore it is
not improbable, that the people, who through the want of
clocks would oftener look to the dial than to the weathercock,
gave to the tower a name alluding to the former rather than
to the latter.</p>

<p>Du Cange says, that a triton, by way of weathercock, was
placed on the temple of Androgeus at Rome; but I am unacquainted
with the source from which he derived this information,
and of that temple I have not been able to obtain
any <span class="locked">account<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a></span>. Whether the tritons placed on the temple of
Saturn at Rome were indicators of the wind, or whether they
had a learned signification, as Macrobius asserts, I will not
venture to <span class="locked">determine<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a></span>. It is probable that the pillar, some
remains of which were found at Gaeta (<i>Cajeta</i>), in the kingdom
of Naples, and on which the names of the winds were
cut out in Greek and Latin, served as a wind indicator also.</p>

<p>But it is more than probable that an apparatus for pointing
out the wind, similar to that at Athens, was erected also
at Constantinople. At least I consider as such what was
called by some <i>anemodulium</i>, and by others <i>anemoderium</i>;
the information respecting which has not, as I conceive, been
hitherto understood, not even by Banduri. In my opinion it
was not a building or tower, but a column furnished with a
vane, somewhat similar to what is still seen in many places
on the sea coast, where a high pole is erected with a flag.
This pillar, if I may be allowed the expression, consisted entirely
of copper; it was square, and in height not inferior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the loftiest columns in the city. Its summit formed a pyramid,
and, as I conjecture, an octagonal one, upon which
stood a female figure that turned round with every wind, and
consequently was a vane, only not a triton, as at Athens.
Below it, on each side of the pyramid, were seen a great
many figures, which I will venture to assert were attributes
or images of the winds, to which the female figure pointed.
Nicetas says, that there were observed among them birds,
agricultural implements, the sea with shipping, fishing-boats,
and naked cupids sporting with apples, which in my opinion
denoted the different seasons in which each wind was accustomed
to <span class="locked">blow<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the whole pillar was constructed
of different pieces of copper, cast singly and then joined together;
and it appears that neither Nicetas, nor Cedrenus,
nor the Latins, who in the thirteenth century pulled down
and melted the numerous objects of art, plundered from various
cities by the emperor Constantine to ornament his
capital, were acquainted with the purpose for which this
pillar was originally destined, or the meaning of the emblematical
figures represented upon it. Nay, there is even
reason to think that the Greeks themselves, at this time, were
so ignorant as to believe such objects to be the productions
of magic. According to Cedrenus, this costly wind indicator
was erected by Theodosius the Great, and according to
others by Leo Isauricus. Were the first assertion true, it
would belong to the fourth century, and in the second case
to the eighth; but I cannot help suspecting that it was constructed
before the time of Theodosius. The female figure
which indicated the wind, was, according to Nicetas, called
<i>anemodoulon</i>, but according to Cedrenus <i>anemoderion</i>. The
former denotes a person who belongs to the wind; the latter
one who contends with the wind; and both these appellations
are well suited to a vane or wind indicator. If my explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
be correct, this work of art at Constantinople had
nothing in common with the statue of Jupiter constructed by
Lysippus at <span class="locked">Tarentum<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a></span>. The latter was forty cubits in
height; and what excited great astonishment was, that though
it would shake when pushed with the hand, it withstood the
force of the most violent storms. I should rather compare
the statue of Lysippus to those moveable masses of rock
which are mentioned by various authors, both ancient and
modern.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that there may have been wind indicators
of this kind in other places, and that more passages
alluding to them, not hitherto remarked, may be found in
different authors. Professor Michaelis, who was desirous to
assist me in my researches, pointed out to me an account,
undoubtedly written before the year <span class="locked">1151<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a></span>, in which it is
stated that there was at Hems, in Syria, formerly called
Emessa, a high tower, on the summit of which was a copper
statue of a horseman that turned with every wind. It is
worthy of remark, that under the vane there were figures,
among which was that of a scorpion; in all probability the
emblem of some season.</p>

<p>In Europe, the custom of placing vanes on the summits of
the church-steeples is very old; and as these vanes were made
in the figure of a cock, they have thence been denominated
<i>weathercocks</i>. In the Latin, therefore, of the middle ages,
we meet with the words <i>gallus</i> and <i>ventilogium</i>. The latter
is used by Radulphus, who wrote about the year <span class="locked">1270<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a></span>.
Mention of weathercocks occurs in the <span class="locked">ninth<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a></span>, eleventh,
twelfth and <span class="locked">thirteenth<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a></span> centuries. There is no doubt that
the cock was intended as an emblem of clerical vigilance.
In the ages of ignorance the clergy frequently styled themselves
the cocks of the Almighty, whose duty it was, like the
cock which roused Peter, to call the people to repentance, or
at any rate to <span class="locked">church<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a></span>. The English, therefore, are mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
when they suppose that the figure of a cock was first made
choice of for vanes in the fourteenth century, under the reign
of Edward III., in order to ridicule the French, with whom
they were then at war; and that the custom of <i>cock-throwing</i>,
that is to say, of throwing sticks at a cock exposed with his
wings tied, as then practised, took its rise at the same time.</p>

<p>In France, in the twelfth century, none but noblemen were
allowed to have vanes on their houses; nay, at one time this
was the privilege of those who, at the storming of a town,
first planted their standards on the ramparts. These vanes
were painted with the knights’ arms, or the arms were cut
out in them, and in that case they were called <i>panonceaux</i><a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a>.</p>

<p>Flags or vanes on ships occur very early, but they are
always mentioned on account of their use in making signals.
They were of various forms and colours; were sometimes
drawn up, and sometimes taken down; placed sometimes on
the right and sometimes on the left side of the ship, and were
changed in various other ways, directions for which may be
seen in the Tactics of the emperor Leo. They were named
<i>vexilla</i>, <i>flammulæ</i>, also <i>flammula</i> and <i>banda</i>, and the last
two appellations occur in the works of the younger Greek
<span class="locked">writers<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a></span>.</p>

<p>But though the oldest writers on the art of naval warfare,
such as Vegetius, recommend a knowledge of the winds, I
have not yet met with any certain account of apparatus for
determining the direction of them on board a ship. Before
the discovery of the magnetic needle, such accuracy as is
necessary at present would have been superfluous; yet naval
commanders must long before have had some means of distinguishing
at least the twelve winds then defined, though
no traces of them are to be found in the works which have
been accidentally preserved to us.</p>

<p>Scheffer<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a>, who, as is well-known, collected from the works
of the ancients all the terms of art applicable to navigation,
thinks that the band, <i>tænia</i>, affixed to a pole at the stern of
the <span class="locked">ship<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a></span>, did not serve so much for an ornament as to indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
the course of the wind. He is, however, able to produce
no other authority for this opinion than a passage in one of
Cicero’s letters, which has been changed and amended, till it
at length seems to say that Cicero had resolved to embark,
because the vanes had announced a favourable <span class="locked">wind<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a></span>.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge that at present I can produce no older
information in regard to vanes used on board ship, to indicate
the course of the wind, than of the eleventh century,
taken from the life of Emma, the consort of Canute the Great,
king of Denmark, Norway and England, the author of which
was an eye-witness of what he relates. Describing the magnificent
Norman fleet sent to England in the year 1013, he
says that birds, which turned round with the wind, were
placed on the top of the <span class="locked">masts<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></span>.</p>

<p>At that time, therefore, instead of the flags used at present,
a vane, shaped like a bird, was placed at the summit of
the mast; perhaps also the figure of a cock, as the emblem
of vigilance, but in this case not of clerical vigilance. In the
cathedral of Bayeux, in France, is a piece of tapestry, representing
the actions of William the Conqueror, executed with
the needle, either by his consort or under her direction, in
which vanes are seen at the top of the masts in many of the
<span class="locked">ships<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a></span>.</p>

<p>[Anemoscopes, or instruments for showing the direction of
the wind, are now in constant use in meteorological establishments;
the indications are made upon dials, and the apparatus
does not differ in principle from that described by
Beckmann.</p>

<p>Anemometers, or instruments for measuring the power or
force of the wind, have also been contrived of various kinds.
The first was invented by Wolf. In this the wind acted upon
four sails somewhat resembling those of a windmill, the
motion being communicated by cog-wheels to a lever loaded
with a weight. When the wind acted upon the sails, the bar
rose, this motion continuing until the increased leverage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the weight counterpoised the moving power of the wind.
Others on a different principle have been made by Lind,
Regnier, Martin, and a very beautiful instrument for this
purpose, constructed by Mr. Dent, may be seen at Lloyd’s room
in the Royal Exchange.]</p>

<h2 id="gilding">GILDING.</h2>

<p>The astonishing extensibility of gold, a property in which it
far surpasses all other metals, induced mankind, at an early
period, to attempt beating it into thin plates, as the value of
it led them to the art of covering or gilding things of every
kind with leaves of it. It is proved by Herodotus, that the
Egyptians were accustomed to gild wood and <span class="locked">metals<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a></span>; and
gilding is frequently mentioned in the books of the Old <span class="locked">Testament<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></span>.
The gold plates, however, used for this purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
as may be readily conceived, were not so thin as those made
at present; and for this reason, the gilding on statues, which
have lain many centuries in the earth, appears to be still entire.
Winkelmann <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a></span>, that among the ruins of two apartments
in the imperial palace, on the palatine hill, in the Villa
Farnese, the gold ornaments were found to be as fresh as if
they had been newly applied, though these apartments, in
consequence of being buried under the earth, were exceedingly
damp. The circular bands of sky-blue, with small
figures in gold, could not be seen without admiration. The
gilding also is still preserved in the ruins of Persepolis.</p>

<p>But, in the time of Pliny, the art of gold-beating was carried
so far at Rome, that an ounce of gold could be beat into
seven hundred and fifty leaves and more, each four square
inches in <span class="locked">size<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a></span>. I shall not compare this result with what the
art can do at present, because the account of Pliny is not the
most accurate, and because the conversion of the old measures
into the modern standard is always attended with uncertainty.
Buonarotti, however, who made some researches
on this <span class="locked">subject<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></span>, is of opinion that the gold used at Rome
for fire-gilding in his time, that is, at the end of the seventeenth
century, was beat six times as thin; and that the gold
employed for gilding wood and other things, without the application
of fire, was twenty-two times as thin as the gold leaf
made at Rome in the time of Pliny. But this Italian author,
as appears to me, has, through too great precipitation, translated
the words “septingenæ et quinquagenæ bracteæ” fifty
and seventy. Gold, however, at that time, was beat so thin
at Rome, that Lucretius compares it to a spider’s web, and
Martial to a <span class="locked">vapour<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a></span>.</p>

<p>I have, however, not yet met with any information in regard
to the method in which the ancient artists beat the gold,
or the instruments and apparatus they employed for that purpose.
But the German monk Theophilus, whose real name
seems to have been Rüger, and who, as Lessing thinks, lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
in the ninth, but, according to Morelli, in the twelfth century,
describes the process nearly as it is at <span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a></span>. The gold,
at that time, was beat between parchment, in the same manner
as is still practised; and the artists knew how to prevent
the gold from adhering to the parchment, by covering it over
with burnt ochre reduced to a very fine powder, and then
rubbing it smooth with a tooth. With the like view, our
gold-beaters rub over with a fine bolus the thin paper used
for making the books into which they put their gold leaf, in
order to preserve it. But the flatting-mills, between the steel
rollers of which cast and hammered ingots of gold are at present
reduced to thin leaves, seem not to have been then
known, at least this monk makes no mention of them. Lessing,
to whom we are indebted for this curious fragment of
Theophilus, is of opinion that each artist at that time was
obliged to beat the gold leaf which he used, because gold-beating
was not then a distinct branch of business. This I will
not controvert; but it is no proof of it, that the monk taught
the art to his brethren; for in convents the clergy endeavoured
to make everything they used, in order that they might
purchase as little as possible.</p>

<p>During the progress of the art, it being found that parchment
was too thick and hard for the above purpose, workmen
endeavoured to procure some finer substance, and at length
discovered that the skin of an unborn calf was the most convenient.
By means of this improvement, gold leaf was made
much thinner than it had ever been before possible; but the
art was brought to still greater perfection by employing that
fine pellicle which is detached from the gut of an ox or a cow.
Lancellotti, who wrote in the first half of the seventeenth
<span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a></span>, says that this invention was made by the German
gold-beaters, when, in consequence of the war, they were not
able to obtain from Flanders the skins of unborn calves.</p>

<p>I have often heard that the preparation of this pellicle,
which the French call <i>baudruche</i> and the Dutch <i>liezen</i>, and
which is so thin that two of them must be pasted together, is
a secret, and that the best is obtained from England. But in
the year 1785, when I paid a visit to a very ingenious gold-beater
at Hamburg, he assured me that he prepared this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
substance himself, and that the case was the same with most
of the gold-beaters in Germany. Even in England, in the
year 1763, this art was known only to two or three persons,
who practised it as a business, but kept it so secret that Lewis
was not able to obtain a proper account of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a></span>. In Ireland
also this skin is prepared and sent to <span class="locked">England<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a></span>. When the
French, in the beginning of the revolutionary war, hoped to
out-manœuvre the Germans by the use of aerostatic machines,
it became of some importance to them to obtain a supply of
these skins. On this account, the <i>Commission des armes et
poudres</i> drew up instructions for preparing them, which they
caused to be printed and distributed to all the butchers. At
Strasburg they were printed in French, and at the same time
in German, but in many parts faulty and unintelligible.</p>

<p>About the year 1621, Mersenne excited general astonishment,
when he showed that the Parisian gold-beaters could
beat an ounce of gold into 1600 leaves, which together covered
a surface of 105 square feet. But in 1711, when the
pellicles, discovered by the Germans, came to be used in
Paris, Reaumur found that an ounce of gold, in the form of
a cube, five and a quarter lines at most in length, breadth,
and thickness, and which covered only a surface of about
twenty-seven square lines, could be so extended by the gold-beaters
as to cover a surface of more than one hundred and
forty-six and a half square feet. This extension, therefore,
is nearly one-half more than was possible about a century
before.</p>

<p>When these skins are worn out by the hammer of the gold-beater,
they are employed, under the name of English skin,
for plasters, or properly to unite small wounds. By the
English they are called <i>gold-beaters’ skin</i><a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a>; but, since silk
covered with isinglass and Peruvian balsam, which in Germany
is named English plaster, for the Germans at present
call every thing English, has become the mode, this skin is
much less <span class="locked">used<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a></span>. I mention this that I might have an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of remarking, that in the middle of the twelfth century,
in the Levant at least, a very thin pellicle was in like
manner used for wounds. For when the emperor, John Comnenus,
accidentally wounded himself in the hand with a poisoned
arrow while hunting, a piece of skin, which, from the
name and description may be considered the same as that
used at present by the gold-beaters, was applied to the wound.
The emperor, however, died in consequence of this wound,
after it had become inflamed under the pellicle, which, in
large wounds, and when the skin is suffered to remain too
long, is commonly the case, though the poison alone would
have been a sufficient cause of death. Reaumur and others
are astonished that artists should have sought for and found
a part of their apparatus in the bowels of an ox; but I am of
opinion that this pellicle, which is sometimes separated in
washing and cleaning the bowels, was first observed by the
butchers, and made known by them as a plaster; and that it
came into request among the German gold-beaters, as the
finest of all the pellicles then known, in the beginning of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The art of gilding, and particularly unmetallic bodies, was
much facilitated by the invention of oil-painting; but it must
be acknowledged that the process employed by the ancients
in cold-gilding was nearly the same as that used at present.
Pliny <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a></span> that gold leaves were applied to marble with a
varnish, and to wood with a certain kind of cement, which he
calls <i>leucophoron</i>. Without entering into any research respecting
the minerals employed for this cement, one may readily
conceive that it must have been a ferruginous ochre, or
kind of bole, which is still used as a ground (<i>poliment</i>, <i>assiette</i>)<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a>.
But gilding of this kind must have suffered from dampness,
though many specimens of it are still preserved. Some of
the ancient artists, perhaps, may have employed resinous substances,
on which water can produce very little effect.</p>

<p>That gold-leaf was affixed to metals by means of quicksilver,
with the assistance of heat, in the time of Pliny, we are told
by himself in more places than one. The metal to be gilded
was prepared by salts of every kind, and rubbed with pumice-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>stone
in order to clean it thoroughly, and to render the surface
a little <span class="locked">rough<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a></span>. This process is similar to that used at
present for gilding with amalgam, by means of heat, especially
as amalgamation was known to the ancients. But, to speak
the truth, Pliny says nothing of heating the metal after the
gold is applied, or of evaporating the quicksilver, but of drying
the cleaned metal before the gold is laid on. Had he not
mentioned quicksilver, his gilding might have been considered
as that with gold-leaf by means of heat, <i>dorure en feuille à feu</i>,
in which the gold is laid upon the metal after it has been
cleaned and heated, and strongly rubbed with blood-stone, or
polished steel. Felibien was undoubtedly right when he <span class="locked">regretted<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a></span>
that the process of the ancients, the excellence of
which is proved by remains of antiquity, has been lost.</p>

<p>False gilding, that is, where thin leaves of a white metal,
such as tin or silver, are applied to the article to be gilded,
and then rubbed over with a yellow transparent colour, through
which the metallic splendour appears, is much older than I
believed it to be in the year 1780. The process for this purpose
is given by the monk Theophilus, whose fragments were
first printed in <span class="locked">1781<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a></span>. According to his directions, tin beat
into thin leaves was to be rendered of a golden yellow colour by
a vinous tincture of saffron, so that other pigments could be
applied over it. The varnish or solution of resin in spirit of
wine or oil, used for this purpose at present, appears not then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
to have been known. But in the sixteenth century this art
was very common; and instructions respecting it were given
by <span class="locked">Garzoni<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a></span>, <span class="locked">Cardan<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a></span>, <span class="locked">Caneparius<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a></span> and others in their writings.
About the same period a pewterer at Nuremberg,
named Melchior Koch, was acquainted with the art of communicating
a golden colour, in the like manner, to tin goblets
and dishes. He died in 1567; and with him, as Doppelmayer
says, the art was lost. A method of applying a white metal
to paper, and then drawing over it a gold varnish, has been
known in China since the earliest <span class="locked">periods<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a></span>. At present this
method of gilding is practised more in Sicily than in any other
country. It appears also to have been used, at an early period,
for gilding leather and leather tapestry; and this perhaps was
first attempted at Messina, as we are told by John Matthæus<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a>,
who, however, in another place ascribes the invention to a
saint of Lucca, named Cita. But gilt leather was made as
early as the time of Lucian, who conjectures that Alexander
the impostor had a piece of it bound round his <span class="locked">thigh<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a></span>. The
dress of the priests, on the festival of Bacchus, was perhaps
of the same <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a></span>.</p>

mentioned. Moses caused several parts of the sanctuary to be overlaid
with gold. 1st. The ark of shittim wood was covered with gold both on
the outside and inside, Exodus, chap. xxv. ver. 11; also the staves, ver. 13.

<p>
Now the question is, whether all these were gilt, or covered, or overlaid
with gold plates. But when the passages are compared with each
other, I am inclined to think that gilding is denoted.

<p>
“The Hebrews probably brought the art of gilding with them from
Egypt, where it seems to have been very old, as gilding is found not only
on mummies, the antiquity of which indeed is uncertain; but, if I am not
mistaken, in the oldest temples, on images. It appears also, that in the
time of Moses the Hebrews understood the art both of gilding and of
overlaying with plates of gold, and expressed both by the general term

I do not fully comprehend. It seems to say that the quicksilver, when
the gold was laid on too thin, appeared through it, but that this might be
prevented by mixing with the quicksilver the white of an egg. The quicksilver
then remained under the gold; but this is impossible. When the
smallest drop of quicksilver falls upon gilding, it corrodes the noble metal,
and produces an empty spot. It is therefore incomprehensible to me how
this could be prevented by the white of an egg. Did Pliny himself completely
understand gilding? Perhaps Pliny only meant to say, that many
artists gave out the cold-gilding, where the gold-leaf was laid on with the
white of an egg, as gilding by means of heat. I shall here remark, that
the reader may spare himself the trouble of turning over Durand’s Histoire
Naturelle de l’Or et d’Argent, Londres 1729, fol. This Frenchman did not

<h2 id="fur">FUR DRESSES.</h2>

<p>As long as mankind lived under palm-trees in their original
country, between the tropics, they had no occasion to provide
either food or clothing: the former was spontaneously supplied
by the earth, that is, without care or labour; and the
latter in that warm climate was superfluous. The art of cultivating
plants, and that of preparing clothes, were not innate,
but first taught by necessity; and this did not exist till men,
in consequence of their increase, were obliged to spread towards
both the poles. In proportion as they removed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
their former abode, provisions became scarcer, and the climate
colder. Hence arose the breeding of cattle, as well as agriculture;
and men then first ventured on the cruelty of killing
animals, in order that they might devour them as food, and
use their skins to shelter them against the severity of the
weather.</p>

<p>At first these skins were used raw, without any preparation;
and many nations did not till a late period fall upon the art of
rendering them softer, and making them more pliable, durable,
and convenient. As long as mankind traded only for necessaries,
and paid no attention to ornaments, they turned the hairy side
towards the body; but as the art of dressing skins was not
then understood, the flesh side must have given to this kind
of clothing, when the manners of people began to be more
refined, an appearance which could not fail of exciting disgust.
To prevent this the Ozolæ inverted the skins, and wore the
hair outwards; and in this manner some account for the bad
smell which exhaled from their <span class="locked">bodies<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a></span>. This custom, however,
was so general, that Juvenal, where he describes a miserly
person, says, “to guard himself against the cold he does
not wear the costly woollen clothing of the luxurious Romans,
but the skins of animals, and these even inverted, that is to
say, with the hairy side turned inwards, without caring whether
the appearance be agreeable or <span class="locked">not<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a></span>.” In what manner the
art of tanning was afterwards found out, Goguet has endeavoured
to conjecture from the accounts given by travellers,
in regard to the savages in the northern parts of America and
Asia, but particularly in regard to the Greenlanders. The
far more ingenious method of manufacturing wool, first into
felt and then into cloth, seems to have been discovered by the
inhabitants of temperate districts, where the mildness of the
winter rendered fur dresses unnecessary.</p>

<p>The sheep came from Africa; but in that country it has
hair and not wool; and it is only in colder climates that the
former acquires a woolly nature. If it be true that a Hercules
first brought this species of animal from Africa to
<span class="locked">Greece<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a></span>, that improvement may have first been effected in
the latter country; in which case it is probable that the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
attempts to manufacture wool were made by the Athenians,
that is to say, among the Greeks; for this art was before
known to the Egyptians, who ascribe the invention of it to
their Isis.</p>

<p>It may be readily comprehended that many centuries must
have elapsed before the tender sheep could be conveyed to
and reared in the northern countries, where thick and immense
forests produced in abundance a great variety of those
animals which were capable of supplying the best furs;
where mankind increased but slowly; applied to hunting till
a later period; and were not so soon compelled to employ
artificial methods of obtaining the most necessary productions;
and where they also lived too widely scattered to be
soon conducted to the arts by a communication of experience
and inventions. The northern nations, therefore, clothed
themselves in the raw skins of animals, a long time after the
southern tribes were acquainted with the spinning and weaving
of wool, flax, and cotton; and on this account the former
were astonished at the appearance of the latter.</p>

<p>When the Greeks give us a picture of these barbarians,
they scarcely ever fail to state how disgusting they were on
account of their dress; which however, by the acknowledgement
of their historians, was long worn by their own <span class="locked">forefathers<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a></span>.
The heroes even of the Grecian fabulous history
clothed themselves in the skins of the most terrible <span class="locked">animals<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a></span>,
such as lions and tigers, and on these they also slept. When
the Romans wished to describe the manners of their ancestors,
and to exhibit the difference between them and their own,
they commonly mentioned the use of skins. Thus Propertius
calls the senators of the earliest periods the <i>pelliti</i><a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a>, and
Valerius Maximus <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></span>, speaking of the luxury of his time,
that no one in imitation of Cato would use goat skins as a
covering to his bed. But it appears that the Greeks and
the Romans, at the time of their prosperity, when the arts
and sciences were cultivated among them, made little use of
fur clothing. It was worn at that period only on certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
festivals, and merely by the poorer classes and <span class="locked">rustics<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a></span>, or
employed in the time of <span class="locked">war<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a></span>. At any rate, it is not mentioned
among the dresses of the rich, or articles of magnificence
and ornament.</p>

<p>The ancient physicians, where they treat on the influence
which clothing has on the health, and the choice of it for
winter and summer, make no mention of furs. Suetonius,
describing the manner in which the emperor Augustus
dressed in winter, names various articles of clothing, but no
furs; which the emperor, who was so sensible of cold, would
certainly have worn, had they been usual. They no doubt
would have been much more convenient and answered the
purpose better, than the four <i>tunicæ</i> drawn over each other,
and the thick <i>toga</i>, the woollen shirt and breast-cloth, and all
the other articles mentioned. Martial ridicules a <i>petit-maître</i>,
who wished for the arrival of winter and for severe weather
in that season, in order that he might exhibit his costly winter
dresses. Had furs, at that period, been the fashionable
and principal winter clothing, the poet certainly would not
have omitted to mention them. At present the <i>baccaræ</i> for
the like reason make their appearance as soon as the first
frost takes place, along with large muffs, which leave scarcely
any part of the body to be seen but the head and the feet.
Had furs been employed by way of ornament in the time of
Pliny, he no doubt would have noticed this use of them, especially
as he mentions and ridicules so many superstitious ways
of applying the skins of animals; but I do not remember to have
read in the works of this naturalist any account of fur clothing.
He relates that an attempt had been made to manufacture the
fur of the hare; but it had not succeeded, because the fur,
on account of its shortness, as he supposes, would not adhere,
or, as we say at present, could not be <span class="locked">felted<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a></span>. He, however,
says nothing of hare’s fur being employed to line clothes. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
appears also that furs do not often occur as clothing in the
sacred <span class="locked">scriptures<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></span>. In the third, or perhaps even the second
century of the Christian æra, fur dresses seem to have been
known to the Romans, and to have been much esteemed by
them. The numerous northern tribes, who at that time advanced
towards the south, were clothed in furs; but they
were not all raw, dirty, and disgusting, like those which had
before been in use. It may with certainty be supposed that
the chief men among them had the most beautiful furs; and
that in general they were so well acquainted with the art of
preparing them, and wearing them in the most graceful manner,
that they by these means recommended them to the
notice of the young Romans. For that all those warlike
tribes who attacked the Roman empire, and in part subdued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
it, are not to be considered as uncultivated, savage barbarians,
unacquainted with the arts or the sciences, addicted
to plundering and murder, who overturned governments and
destroyed public happiness and trade, has been lately remarked,
when the French applied the term Vandalism to the
horrid cruelties committed during the late <span class="locked">revolution<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a></span>. It
can be proved that the Romans adopted from their uninvited
guests those kinds of dress; that furs soon became fashionable
among them, and were an object of luxury and of commerce;
and it appears that skins were the first article which
occasioned a trade from Italy to the most distant parts of the
North, as in the fifteenth century they were the cause of the
discovery and conquest of Siberia.</p>

<p>The later the art of manufacturing wool, and of converting
the noble metals into lace and other ornaments, was known,
in the northern countries, and the later the inhabitants became
acquainted with cotton, silk, and precious stones, the
earlier and the more they exerted themselves to find out and
prepare the most beautiful furs, and to trim and to border
with them their dresses; and it needs excite no surprise that
the southern nations, though their climate did not require it,
adopted this magnificence; especially as the distance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
scarcity of furs made them dear enough to be considered by
the rich and people of rank as a luxurious mark of distinction.
This, in my opinion, will be proved by what follows.</p>

<p>When historians speak of those northern nations with whom
the Romans carried on long and for the most part unfortunate
wars, they scarcely ever forget to mention their fur clothing;
and this is the case in particular with those writers who lived
at the time. We are told by Herodotus, that the people
near the Caspian sea clothed themselves in seal-skins. The
same thing is related by Strabo of the Massagetæ; and Cæsar
and Sallust both assert, that the skin of the rein-deer formed
in part the clothing of the ancient Germans. I allude here
to those dresses which they call <i>renones</i>. That this word is
derived from the animal named at present by the Swedes <i>Ren</i>;
that the rein-deer was common in ancient Germany, when,
in consequence of its being covered with forests and marshes,
it had a much colder climate and produced more rein-deer
moss than at present; and that Cæsar, where he describes
the most remarkable things of Germany, mentions the rein-deer
under the name of <i>bos cervi figura</i>, I think I have proved
in my juvenile production on the ancient animals of that
country. <i>Reno</i> is also <i>Lappmud</i>, or the rein-deer skin,
which is still worn in Sweden, which I have worn there myself,
and which is handsome and costly. The objection of
<span class="locked">Wachter<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a></span> to this opinion is of very little weight. How is it
possible to believe, says he, that these animals were formerly
so numerous, that all the Germans and Gauls could clothe
themselves in their skins? But on this occasion he does not
recollect what he has often proved by examples, that the
name of a species is often given to the whole genus. Because
a great many wore <i>renones</i>, of which the Romans
perhaps were fondest, they gave the name of <i>renones</i> to all
these fur dresses of the Germans. The proofs, in ancient
authors, in regard to the fur clothing of the Scythians, the
Goths, the Getæ, and Huns, are too numerous to be collected.
I shall therefore refer only to those passages which I have
occasionally remarked, and which I shall soon employ for
another <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
It can easily be proved that the Germans and other northern
nations, in consequence of their intercourse with the Romans,
gradually left off the use of furs, and became more and
more accustomed to woollen clothing; and, on the other hand,
that the Romans adopted the state dress of their conquerors.
Even in the time of Tacitus, those Germans who lived on the
Rhine and the Danube, and consequently who were nearest
to the Romans, set much less value on furs than those who,
residing further within the country, were at a greater distance
from intercourse with foreigners and from <span class="locked">trade<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a></span>. The latter
had the most costly furs, which they knew how to ornament
and variegate with trimmings of every kind, in the
same manner perhaps as our furriers at present ornament
white fur with the tail of the <span class="locked">ermine<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></span>. These people possessed
no other articles of luxury, and had no other means of
distinguishing themselves among their countrymen, but by
the rarity and costliness of their furs. Such was the case
with the Spartans when Lycurgus deprived them of all their
superfluities. They then ornamented, and thereby enhanced
the value of the necessary articles they had left, beds, tables
and wooden bowls, from which they drank water, and to
such a degree, that at length these things were as capable of
gratifying the taste of luxury as the foreign wares they had
before purchased at so dear a <span class="locked">rate<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a></span>.</p>

<p>The same thing has been remarked by the Danish and
Swedish historians. When these nations, by their sea voyages,
piratical expeditions and trade, became acquainted with foreign
manners, and more convenient kinds of clothing, they
accustomed themselves to wool, cotton and silk; yet, in so
slow a manner, that the use of these wares was introduced as
an extravagant luxury. Harold Härdrät Sigurdson, or Harold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
IV. king of Norway, in the middle of the eleventh century,
who had collected great riches in the Levant, wore a
red mantle lined with white furs. In the twelfth century
the principal men at the Danish court were clothed in <span class="locked">sheep-skins<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></span>;
and when Duke Canute, or Canute Laward, the son
of Eric Eiegod, who was assassinated in the year 1131, appeared
at a festival at Ripe in a dress of red cloth, he excited
attention and envy, and was subjected to the mortification of
hearing the most bitter sarcasms from Henry Skatteler, or
rather Skokal, that is, the lame, who wore a native <span class="locked">sheep-skin<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a></span>.</p>

<p>That furs were considered by the Getæ as objects of magnificence,
and that as such they were worn by their kings and
the principal men at court, is proved by the passages I have
quoted. The reproach thrown out by Claudian against Rufinus,
that he was not ashamed to wear Getic furs, proves
that the Romans adopted the manners of their conquerors,
and that this practice was censured by their patriots. It is
worthy of remark also, that the jurists, Ulpian and Paulus,
reckon furs among articles of dress, to which before their
time they did not <span class="locked">belong<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a></span>.</p>

<p>Acron, an old commentator on Horace, whose period, as
far as I know, has not yet been determined, says that in his
time the senators and principal men, when they appeared in
their official dresses, wore costly furs obtained from foreign
countries, and <span class="locked">Tertullian<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a></span> indignantly inveighs against the
female dresses bordered and trimmed with furs, which seem
to be mentioned also by bishop Maximus in the fifth century.</p>

<p>In the year 397, the emperor Honorius forbade Gothic
dresses, and in particular furs, to be worn either in Rome or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
within the jurisdiction of the city; but that such orders
against fashions had very little effect appears from this circumstance,
that these laws, extended as well as rendered
more severe, were renewed in 399 and 416, and yet were not
obeyed. Even the Goths themselves were forbidden to use
such dresses. The Gothic servants, who at that time were
kept in most families, were to be subjected to corporal punishment,
and those of higher rank to a fine, in case they transgressed
this prohibition. But Synesius, who lived at that
period, and as a good patriot lamented the use of these outlandish
dresses, which afforded a melancholy presage that the
dominion of the Goths would at length prevail, relates, that
the principal men among these people appeared at Rome in
the Roman dress, but on their return home they exchanged
it for their native clothing, and again assumed their furs.</p>

<p>Furs, however, were not the only part of the Gothic costume
which became modish among the Romans; for they
adopted also their breeches or hose. That such articles of
dress were not used before that time, either by the Greeks,
the Romans, or the Hebrews, has been proved by many. On
this account mention is so often made of indecent postures,
as when the Scotch Highlanders <i>rendent les armes</i>, by which
parts are exposed that modesty requires to be concealed.
This is considered by Theophrastus as one of the marks of
<span class="locked">clownishness<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a></span>. Thus, a posture inadvertently assumed, exposed
Philip to reproach, as we are told by <span class="locked">Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a></span>; and
to guard against a similar indecorum, Cæsar, as he fell, collected
his robes around him. Hence, as is well known, the
expression retained by Luther, <i>seine Füsse bedecken</i>, “to
cover one’s feet,” or as the Greeks say, “to compose one’s
<span class="locked">clothes<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a></span>.” Persons who laboured under weakness or indisposition,
wrapped bandages around their legs; and in the
time of Quintilian, the use of these could be excused only by
<span class="locked">sickness<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a></span>. They, however, became afterwards more common,
so that by Ulpian they are reckoned among the ordinary
articles of <span class="locked">dress<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a></span>. They formed a step towards breeches,
properly so called, which, as is well known, covered for many
centuries the loins, thighs and legs, as may be seen on seals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
and carved work of the thirteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a></span>. That the Batavians,
Gauls, Germans, Sarmatians, Getæ, Goths, &amp;c. had
such articles of clothing, is proved by many passages in ancient
authors, already quoted by others, and by the well-known
appellation <i>Gallia braccata</i>. The <i>anaxurides</i> also of
the Persians were breeches, which the Romans adopted, not
from these people, but from the northern nations, yet without
the approbation of the patriots, who exclaimed against them,
as they had before done against furs. At first they seem to
have been used only on journeys and in war. When the
Gothic costume was forbidden by Honorius, breeches were
expressly mentioned; and Ovid reproaches the people of
Tomi, on the Pontus Euxinus, that though they wished to be
thought of Greek extraction, they were not ashamed to wear
Persian <span class="locked">breeches<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a></span>.</p>

<p>As furs for dresses of ceremony were either not used at all
by the Greeks and the Romans, or were adopted only at a
late period and seldom employed, an account of the fur trade
is not to be expected in their writings. I am well aware that
Isaac Vossius had an idea that the history of the golden fleece
might be considered as the oldest trace of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a></span>, and therefore
asserted that the object of the Argonautic expedition to Colchis
was a commercial speculation, as was the case with the
voyages of the English to Nootka Sound. It is also true
that this opinion met with some approbation; but it has no
more probability than that entertained by the alchymists in
regard to the same expedition since the time of Suidas.
That the Colchi, indeed, carried on a very extensive trade is
sufficiently proved by the testimony of Pliny and Strabo;
but the latter, in the catalogue of wares, mentions timber for
ship-building, pitch, wax, linen and hemp, but not furs, which
at that time could not be an article much sought after in
foreign commerce.</p>

<p>Another account which we read in Pliny seems much
rather to refer to the fur trade. I here allude to that quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
by Böttiger<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a>, from which it appears that furs were reckoned
among the articles obtained at that time from the <span class="locked">Seres<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a></span>. I,
however, freely confess that I cannot readily admit this single
word of Pliny as a complete proof. As far as I have yet
been able to find, other writers, among the articles furnished
by the Chinese, mention iron, pearls, silk, cotton, and silk or
cotton clothes, but say nothing of furs; and it is very improbable
that a country which produced silk or cotton could
supply such furs as would be worth conveying to so great a
distance. The only thing I can admit is, that the furs were
brought by a transit trade to Europe; that is to say, the Seres
obtained them from the fur countries, properly so called, or
those which at present furnish sables, and again sold them to
the Romans. Now this was a very circuitous route, whether
we consider <i>Serica</i> to have been China, Siam, or the Lesser
Bucharia; yet not so circuitous as that by which the Chinese
obtained from the English, through Russia, the best beaver-skins
brought from Canada and Hudson’s Bay.</p>

<p>Were we to reckon among the <i>pelles Serum</i> of Pliny the
<i>lucida vellera</i>, <i>tactu mollia Serum</i>, mentioned by Seneca,
Boethius and others, we should undoubtedly be in an error;
for these may be explained by the false information which
at that time was obtained partly in regard to cotton, and
partly in regard to silk, and which may be seen in <span class="locked">Solinus<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a></span>
and others. Is it not possible that these <i>lucida vellera</i> may
have been meant likewise by Pliny?</p>

<p>I have some doubts also respecting a passage of Strabo,
where he relates that among the wares brought by the nomadic
tribes of Europe and Asia to the Tanais, or present
Azoph, at the mouth of the Don, there were slaves and <span class="locked">furs<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></span>.
It is certain that <i>dermata</i> may signify, not only furs, but also
tanned skins. If Strabo here meant furs, I am inclined to
conjecture that they were disposed of in the nearest countries,
but did not come into the European trade; and the case,
perhaps, was the same with the slaves mentioned in the same
passage. Polybius also, among the wares brought from Pontus
to Byzantium, mentions <i>dermata</i><a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a>. I must, however, confess,
that if I found that the Romans actually obtained <i>dermata</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
from Asia, I should carefully examine whether under that
term skins, or even dyed leather, were not rather meant.
Skins, and particularly for military purposes, they indeed
procured from very distant places. Thus the Frieslanders,
instead of a tax, were obliged to supply <span class="locked">ox-hides<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a></span>; and it
may be proved by the testimony of various writers, that the
art of giving a beautiful dye to leather is very old in Asia;
and therefore that many kinds of what we call morocco was
at an early period brought from thence to Europe.</p>

<p>On the other hand, from what is said by Ælian<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a>, I entertain
no doubt that in his time a trade in furs was carried on
with Persia. To that country were sent, he says, the soft
skins of the Pontic mouse, which, when sewed together,
formed warm dresses. I am convinced also that more proofs
might be found of the use of fur-clothing among the Persians.
They employed furs likewise instead of mattresses and bolsters.
Thus we are told by <span class="locked">Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a></span> that Pharnabazus reclined
upon soft furs: and it is not improbable that the rough
or thick winter gloves of the Persians, mentioned by Xenophon,
were of the same <span class="locked">material<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a></span>. It is stated by modern
travellers, that at present sable and ermine skins are among
the most common and valuable ornaments of the Persians;
and it is well known that the costume of these people is very
old, because they are not exposed as we are to the influence
of fickle fashion.</p>

<p>But the Persian skins, <i>pelles Parthicæ</i> or <i>Persicæ</i>, which
are often extolled, especially in later times, on account of
their beauty, do not belong to this head; though Vossius,
Brisson and Gesner, consider them to have been sables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
They were undoubtedly different kinds of dyed leather, of
which shoes were made for princes and opulent persons. In
the time of the emperor Maximianus, a Roman soldier having
found a leathern purse which contained real pearls, threw
away the latter and retained only the purse, because it had a
beautiful <span class="locked">colour<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a></span>. Of the same kind of leather was that dyed
with kermes, mentioned by <span class="locked">Zosimus<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a></span>; and that which by
Constantine Porphyrogenetes, where he mentions all those
wares which the northern nations obtained through Constantinople,
is expressly named highly-dyed Persian leather.</p>

<p>Of a similar kind, as appears, was the Babylonian leather.
<span class="locked">Zonaras<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a></span> speaks of a costly tent made of it; and in the time
of St. Jerome it was considered as an object of luxury. As
Persian and Babylonian leather are mentioned at the same
time, there is reason to think that a distinction was made in
commerce between these two <span class="locked">kinds<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a></span>. The emperor Constantine,
among the persons charged to furnish articles for the
imperial wardrobe at Constantinople, and who on that account
enjoyed certain immunities, mentions the <i>parthicarii</i>, <i>particarii</i>,
or <i>parthiarii</i><a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a>; and though we are uncertain in regard
to the orthography, it may be readily conceived that these
words do not allude, as Vossius says, to furriers, but to merchants
who dealt in costly dyed, and perhaps painted skins,
which they procured from Persia. It is well-known that at
present the Persians understand the art of preparing and
dyeing many kinds of leather in a more beautiful manner than
the Europeans; and among these in particular are shagreen
and morocco, which are still imported from the <span class="locked">East<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a></span>.</p>

<p>From the grounds here adduced, I am led to conjecture
that the trade in furs to the southern parts of Europe had its
commencement during the expeditions of the northern tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
to Italy; and I must acknowledge that I have found no older
information on this subject than that furnished by Jordanes
or Jornandes, who lived in the sixth century. This writer,
speaking of the northern nations, mentions the <i>Suethans</i>, and
<span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a></span>, that these are the people who send to the Romans the
celebrated furs; which, however, passed necessarily through
the hands of many intermediate tribes. These Suethans, according
to his account, inhabited a part of <i>Scanzia</i>, and that
under this name he included Sweden, Norway, Lapland, Finland,
&amp;c. has been already proved by <span class="locked">Mascou<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a></span>. Soon after
he mentions also <i>Hanugari</i>, whom he reckons among the
Scythians; these he says were known on account of their
trade with <span class="locked">mouse-skins<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is too well known to require any proof, that in the oldest
periods the whole riches of the northern countries consisted
in furs; that these, if not the only, were the principal wares
exported, and that all taxes were paid with them. Other,
who lived in the ninth century, states the number of marten,
rein-deer, bear and otter skins, which were delivered
annually by the Finlanders and <span class="locked">Norwegians<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a></span>. When Thorolf,
in the year 878, sent a ship to England with merchandise,
there were among it <i>pelles mustelinæ albæ</i><a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a>. I shall remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
also, that so early as the third century skins and leather began
to be counted by <i>decuriæ</i>; from which is derived the appellation
<i>decher</i>, adopted into the English, Swedish and Danish
languages, as well as the word <i>dacra</i> or <i>dacrum pellium</i><a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a>, used
in the middle ages. Sables and ermines, however, are still
sold by <i>zimmern</i>; and this appellation also is very old. A
<i>timber</i> of hare-skins occurs about the year 1300, and <i>unum
timbrium martrinarum</i> as early as 1207. At present a <i>zimmer</i>
makes four <i>dechers</i> or twenty pairs, and in the time of George
Agricola sable-skins were sold in this manner, forty in one
<span class="locked">lot<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a></span>. But a <i>zimmer</i> has not always been the same in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
countries and at all times; at any rate in France a <i>zimmer</i>,
<i>timbre</i>, was reckoned to contain sixty skins.</p>

<p>Before I proceed further, I must endeavour to explain the
different names of furs which occur in the works of the ancients;
but in this attempt I can scarcely hope to attain to
great probability. The information of the ancients in regard
to those species of animals with the country of which they
were not acquainted, is exceedingly defective. What they
relate was obtained from the accounts of merchants; and
these, in all probability, through a principle of self-interest,
falsified the little that they really knew. Besides, the ancient
writers do not always accurately distinguish the names
of the different furs, nor affix to them the same meaning;
which is the less surprising, as few know how to give proper
names to the principal kinds of furs even at present. It is
probable that the skins of the ermine, marten, and squirrel,
became at a very early period objects of commerce, and
formed the chief articles in this branch of trade; but from
the little known on this subject, no zoologist would venture
to determine with certainty the species. He must be so
candid as to admit all conjectures which he is not able to
refute.</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken, the skin of the mouse, and particularly
the Pontic or Caspian mouse, is that of which the first
and most frequent mention occurs in the oldest times. That
the name <i>mus</i> denoted at first not only that animal to which
we apply it, but also all small warm-blooded quadrupeds, has
been long ago remarked. In the same manner every large
animal was formerly called <i>bos</i>. When the Romans first saw
elephants they gave them the name of <i>boves lucæ</i>. Pausanias
also calls the rhinoceros the Ethiopian ox; and Cæsar
names the rein-deer, the ox with stag’s horns. The ox was
the largest, as the mouse was the smallest, warm-blooded animal
with which the ancients were acquainted, and therefore
they called all large animals oxen, and all small ones <span class="locked">mice<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a></span>.
It is to be observed, in explaining the ancient names of animals,
that at first they had a much more extensive signification,
and one must endeavour to conjecture what the animals
comprehended under them had in common with each other,
according to the ideas of the ancients. To words of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
<i>formica</i> seems to belong, and perhaps the principal idea related
to collecting and laying up; and perhaps in this manner
one might be able to explain the fable of the gold-searching
ants, mentioned by Herodotus. It is however often difficult
to conjecture what the principal idea was. What idea
did the ancients affix to the term <i>passer</i> (sparrow), when they
called the ostrich the large Libyan or Arabian sparrow? We
learn nothing more therefore from the words <i>pelles murium</i>,
than that they were not the skins of large animals. The
epithets Pontic and Caspian only show, that these wares, like
many others, were brought from Pontus and the Caspian sea.
From such epithets were we to determine the original country
of any article used in commerce, or the place where it
was first produced, we should often fall into error. Wares
were frequently called Syrian, Turkish and Arabian, though
it is certain that they were brought from very different countries.</p>

<p>What further information I have been able to find in regard
to this species of animal, merely is, that its skin was
exceedingly soft; that it formed a good defence against the
wind, and that a great many of them were sewed together in
order to make a <span class="locked">garment<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a></span>. Now, if credit be given to the
account of Aristotle and Pliny, that the Pontic mouse belongs
to the ruminating class of animals, how can anything
characteristic be deduced from it?</p>

<p>Those who wish to afford more room for conjecture might,
from a passage of St. Jerome, render it probable that this
kind of fur had the same smell as musk. Musk indeed was
then known; but is it not possible that this father may have
considered the musk animal to be a mouse, as Conrad Gesner
suspected? To me it is more probable that he was acquainted
with the musk bags used in commerce, and named
them <i>peregrini muris olentes pelliculæ</i>. It however cannot
be proved by this passage, that the skin of the musk animal
was purchased for fur clothing on account of its smell. For,
in the first place, the skin of this animal, with the hair on it,
has not a musky smell; and this is known not only from the
description given of it, but is proved by a skin which I obtained
in a very fresh state. In the second place, this animal
is as large as a deer half a year old; the size therefore will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
not warrant the use of the diminutive <i>pellicula</i>. And, in the
third place, the skin does not afford valuable fur. The hair
is thick; almost bristly, and so tender that it breaks with
the least force. These skins are used only by the natives of
the country where they are produced, for caps and winter
clothing; but when they have been freed from the hair, and
tanned white, they form leather exceedingly soft and fine.
Those who are satisfied with an appearance of probability
may recollect, in reading the passage of Jerome, that the
sable, when daily used, throws out a faint and not unpleasant
smell of musk, and assert that the Pontic mouse was the
sable.</p>

<p>Far more probable is the conjecture of our great zoologist,
that <i>mus Ponticus</i> was the name given at first to the earless
marmot, <i>M. catili</i>, and that it was afterwards applied to the
squirrel and <span class="locked">ermine<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a></span>. This opinion he supports by the observation,
that the torpidity in winter, the rumination, and
the affinity to the alpine mouse, <i>M. alpinus</i>, which Pliny
seems to <span class="locked">acknowledge<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a></span>, agree better with the <i>M. catili</i> than
any other animal. To this may be added, that it is said by
Hesychius and Phavorinus, that the Parthian name of the
animal was <i>simoor</i>; and that the earless marmot is still named
by the Tartars <i>symron</i>, and by the Calmucks <i>dshymbura</i>.
The similarity is indeed great, and this opinion is further
confirmed by the skins of the earless marmot being used at
present by some of the Siberian tribes for summer clothing,
and sent as articles of commerce, with other furs, to China,
though they belong only to the cheapest kinds, so that a thousand
of them cost scarcely eight or ten <span class="locked">roubles<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a></span>.</p>

<p>Amidst this scanty information, were I allowed to offer a
conjecture, I should be inclined rather to the opinion of those
who consider the Pontic mouse to have been our ermine.
For, in the first place, this animal is very abundant in the
countries from which the ancients obtained their beautiful
furs; and it seems almost impossible that they should not at
an early period have remarked the superiority of its skin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
that of the earless marmot. Secondly, it appears that the
Pontic mouse has been commonly considered as the ermine,
since that name in general was known; and there is reason
to think that our forefathers could not err in the name of
an article which has been uninterruptedly employed in commerce.</p>

<p>The name ermine occurs very often in works of the middle
ages, and written in various ways, such as <i>Harmellina</i>, <i>Harmelinus</i>,
<i>Ermelinus</i>, <i>Harminiæ</i> and <i>Arminiæ</i> or <i>Armerinæ</i>
or <i>hereminiæ pelles</i>, <i>Ermena</i>, <i>Erminea</i> and <i>erminatus</i>, ornamented
with ermine; all which words Du Cange supports by
proofs. At what time these names were first used I am not
able to determine; but they are to be found, at any rate, as
early as the eleventh century, in the letters of Peter <span class="locked">Damiani<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a></span>.
Du Cange asserts that they came from Armenia, in
which country this kind of fur was in old times highly
esteemed, as is proved by a passage in Julius Pollux; and this
appears the more probable, from the circumstance that the
words <i>Hermenia</i> and <i>Hermenii</i> were formerly used and written
instead of <i>Armenia</i> and <i>Armenii</i><a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a>. Fischer has rejected
this opinion too inconsiderately, because the ermine was not
procured from Armenia, but sent through it, from the northern
countries to Europe. The same thing is said by Du
Cange; but he gives it to be understood that this commodity
was among the Armenian productions; and even if he has
erred in this respect, his derivation still remains the most probable.
Marco Polo, the celebrated traveller of the thirteenth
century, mentions the ermine among the most expensive ornaments
of the Tartars, and says that it was brought from the
northern countries to Europe.</p>

<p>The sable seems to have been known much later than the
ermine. Its real country is the most northern part of Asia,
to which commerce was not extended till a late period; yet
it is probable that it was known before the Russians became
acquainted with Siberia, by means of the Permians, Woguls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
and Samoeides, at the end of the fifteenth century. It is also
fully proved that the fine furs of Siberia were the production
which induced the Russians to make a conquest of that <span class="locked">country<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a></span>.
Besides, sables existed formerly in Permia, where at
present they are very scarce. The numerous remains of antiquity
still found in Siberia prove that at a very early period
it was inhabited by a people who carried on commerce, and
were well-acquainted with the arts.</p>

<p>Conrad Gesner believed that the name sable occurs for the
first time in Albertus Magnus, who wrote in the thirteenth
century, under the word <i>Cebalus</i>, or <i>Chebalus</i>. In the same
century Marco Polo mentions, at least in the Latin translation,
<i>zibellina pellis</i>, as a valuable kind of fur. But if <i>sabelum</i>
be the sable, as the similarity of the word seems to show, it
must have been known in the twelfth century, and even earlier.
The name <i>sabelum</i> occurs in Alanus Insulanus, and Du Cange
found <i>sabelinæ pelles</i> as early as the year 1138, though <i>sabelum</i>
perhaps means the marten. <i>Gebellinica pellis</i>, <i>gibelini</i>
or <i>gibellini martores</i>, were mentioned in the eleventh century,
and <i>sabellinæ</i> and <i>gebellinicæ pelles</i> were undoubtedly the
<span class="locked">same<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a></span>. I shall not however enter further into this inquiry,
which it appears would be endless, and at the same time of
little benefit.</p>

<p>The marten, the fur of which approaches nearest to that of
the sable, appears to be first mentioned by Martial, who says,
speaking of an unsuccessful hunting excursion, that the hunter
was overjoyed if he caught only a <span class="locked">marten<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a></span>. But the reading
is very doubtful; for many, instead of <i>martes</i>, read <i>meles</i>;
and the latter occurs in Varro, Pliny, and other writers,
whereas the former is found nowhere else. In the middle
ages, however, or at any rate in the twelfth century, <i>martures</i>,
<i>mardrini</i>, and <i>marturinæ vestes</i> frequently occur; and I can
see no reason why they may not be considered as marten
skins, a name which has been retained in all the European
languages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
With as little certainty can it be determined what our forefathers
meant by the words <i>vares</i>, <i>varii</i>, <i>vairus</i>, <i>vajus</i>, <i>varus</i>,
<i>vayrus</i>, <i>veyrus</i> or the <i>vair</i> of the French, and under <i>griseum</i>
and <i>grisum</i>. That they belong to costly kinds of fur is universally
admitted. Sometimes <i>varium</i> and <i>griseum</i> appear to
be the same; and sometimes the former seems to be more
valuable than the latter. That the former was spotted, or
parti-coloured, is apparently announced by the name; for
both the leopard and panther are by Pliny called <i>variæ</i>. What
in heraldry is named by the French <i>vair</i>, and the Germans
<i>eisenhütlein</i>, <i>vellus varium</i>, and which is considered by the
former as the skin of an animal gray on the back and white
on the <span class="locked">belly<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a></span>, alludes to this also. Sometimes, however, it
seems to signify a fur dress composed of differently-coloured
pieces of fur sewed together. Most writers are of opinion
that it means <i>grauwerk</i>, <i>petit-gris</i>, <i>vech</i>, <i>veh</i>, <i>vech</i>, <i>vehwammen</i>,
also the squirrel; and there is certainly a species of that animal
which might justify the name <i>varius</i>, as its skin is at present
employed for variegated bordering or trimming; but I do
not know whether <i>grauwerk</i><a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> could be so dear as <i>varium</i> is
said to have been, as it is among the productions of Europe,
though the best at present comes from Siberia. The word
<i>veeh</i> is derived, as Frisch says, from the Italian <i>vaio</i>; the
latter, according to <span class="locked">Muratori<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a></span>, is formed from <i>varius</i>, and
even at present a dress lined with fur is called <i>roba vaja</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cirogillinæ pelles</i>, named by the council of Paris in the
year 1212, were rabbit <span class="locked">skins<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a></span>. Rabbit warrens, so early as
the thirteenth century, were not scarce in England; for in a
letter of grace respecting the forests, in 1215, every proprietor
was permitted to establish them on his own <span class="locked">lands<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a></span>.</p>

<p>By the term <i>cattinæ pelles</i><a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a>, which are also often named,
must undoubtedly be understood cats’ skins. In France, in
the twelfth century, the skins of native animals were considered
as of little value; but the Spanish and Italian were highly
prized. The skins of the black fox, which at present are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
dearest kind of furs, as a single one in Russia is often sold for
six hundred and even a thousand roubles, occur in the thirteenth
century, among the wares which were sent from the
most northern countries to <span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a></span>; and without doubt these
were meant by Damiani in the passage above <span class="locked">quoted<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a></span>.</p>

<p>Clothing made of the beaver skin occurs much earlier. It
seems to be mentioned by <span class="locked">Claudian<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a></span> in the fourth century;
and it is spoken of by <span class="locked">Ambrosius<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a></span>, who lived at the same
period. Sidonius Apollinaris, in the fifth century, called those
who wore it <i>castorinati</i>. The scholiast of Juvenal, who indeed
belongs to an unknown but much later period, has also
<i>pelles bebrinæ</i> or <i>beverinæ</i>. As the ermine was called the
Pontic mouse, the beaver was named the Pontic dog.</p>

<p>I however firmly believe that this castor clothing was no
more fur clothing, than our beaver hats are fur hats. At that
time the hair was spun and wove; and Claudian, in my opinion,
speaks of a worn-out beaver dress, which had nothing
more left of that valuable fur but the name. This method of
manufacturing beavers’ hair seems not to have been known
in the time of Pliny; for though he speaks much of the castor,
and mentions <i>pellis fibrina</i><a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> three times, he says nothing in
regard to manufacturing the hair, or to beaver fur. As attempts,
however, had then been made to manufacture the fur
of the hare, it is probable that beaver hair began to be worn
soon after. Isidorus, who lived nearly about that period, as
he died in 636, reckons beaver hair, which he calls <i>fibrinum</i>,
among the materials employed for making <span class="locked">cloth<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a></span>; and where
he enumerates the different kinds of cloth, he mentions also
<i>vestis fibrina</i>, and says that the warp was of beaver, and the
woof of goats’ hair, perhaps the so-called camel <span class="locked">hair<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a></span>. An
upper garment of this cloth was worn by the emperor Nicephorus
II. Phocas, at his coronation in the year 963, which
undoubtedly was not a castor pelisse; because fur clothing,
as I shall soon prove, was not fashionable at the court of the
Greek <span class="locked">emperors<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
It deserves here to be remarked, that furs began to be dyed
so early as the twelfth century; and it appears that the colour
was chiefly red, for we find <i>pelles rubricatæ arietum</i>, that is,
sheep-skins dyed red; but Du Cange thinks he can prove
that the skins of the marten and ermine were dyed of the same
colour. This I can believe in regard to the ermine; but to
dye the dark fur of the marten and sable would, in my opinion,
be hardly possible. St. <span class="locked">Bernard<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a></span> says, that such red dyed
leather in the twelfth century was called <i>gulæ</i>, which, with
<i>Hermin engolé</i> of the old poets, seems to signify the same
thing, ermine skins dyed red.</p>

<p>When fur dresses became fashionable in Italy, they were
soon spread all over Europe. At first the best indigenous
furs were employed; but afterwards those of foreign countries,
as being superior; and the dearer they were, the more they
were esteemed. At every court they formed the state costume
of the reigning family, and in a little time that of the richest
nobility. In particular, the mantle, <i>cottes d’armes</i> of the
knights, which they drew over their cuirass or harness, was
bordered with the costliest furs. It had no sleeves, and resembled
the dress of ceremony worn by our heralds. On
this account, as is well known, ermine and other kinds of fur
became parts of the oldest coats of arms. Sometimes magnificence,
in this respect, was carried to such an extravagant
length, that moralists declaimed against it, while governments
endeavoured to limit the use of furs by laws, and the clergy to
prohibit them entirely. Many kinds, therefore, were retained
only by the principal nobility, and others were forbidden.</p>

<p>Charlemagne, however, wore in winter a pelisse which
covered his shoulders and breast; but being an enemy to all
foreign dress, he employed only the furs of his native country;
and, according to the statement of some manuscripts, otter
skins <span class="locked">alone<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a></span>. It nevertheless appears that the costly oriental
furs were then known at his court; for having gone out hunting
with his suite, on a cold rainy holiday, he himself wore
only a sheep’s skin; but the dresses of his attendants, who had
become acquainted in Italy with the valuable articles in which
the Venetians then dealt, consisted of foreign cloth and furs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
These, when thoroughly drenched and dried at the fire, crumbled
to pieces. The emperor then caused his sheep’s skin
when dried to be rubbed, and showing it to his courtiers
ridiculed them on their foreign fur dresses, which though
expensive were of little <span class="locked">use<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a></span>. The imperial princesses, however,
on holidays wore dresses ornamented with precious
stones, gold, silver and silk, and also foreign furs; at any rate
the princess Berta had a valuable mantle or tippet of ermine,
which Alcuin calls <i>murina</i><a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a>.</p>

<p>Fur gloves were at that time usual also. The monks, at
least, in winter wore gloves of sheep’s skin, which were called
<i>muffulæ</i>; whereas the summer gloves were named <i>wanti</i><a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a>.</p>

<p>In the Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, who reigned in the tenth
century, the skin of an ox, a deer, a fox, a wolf and an otter,
are estimated at the same price, that is, eight times as dear
as the skin of a sheep or a goat. The skin of a white weazle
was eleven times as dear, that of a marten twenty-four times,
and that of a beaver one hundred and <span class="locked">twenty<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1001 the emperor Otto III. sent an ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
to Constantinople, whose attendants were clothed in costly
<span class="locked">furs<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a></span>. Adam of Bremen, who lived in the same century, says,
in his description of the countries bordering on Poland and
Russia, that from these districts were procured those costly
furs which were so eagerly purchased by the <span class="locked">luxurious<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a></span>.
When Godfrey of Bouillon, in the year 1096, paid a visit to
the emperor Alexius at Constantinople, what the latter chiefly
admired was the rich and costly dresses of the Europeans
bordered with <span class="locked">furs<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></span>. In the beginning of the twelfth century
the canons of a cathedral suffered themselves to be corrupted
by beautiful <span class="locked">furs<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a></span>. The use of them, however, was forbidden
to the clergy at one of the councils. According to that of
London, in 1127, the abbesses and nuns were to wear those
only made of lamb-skins and <span class="locked">cat-skins<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a></span>. In the year 1187,
when the Christians were beaten near Tiberias, count Raimond
having treacherously gone over to the Turks, the latter found
among the plunder of the Christian camp a complete assortment
of <span class="locked">furs<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a></span>. At the end of the twelfth century, Gottfried
or Gaufred, prior of Vigeois, complained that no one would
any longer wear sheep-skins and fox-skins, which before had
been worn by barons and the principal <span class="locked">clergy<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a></span>.</p>

<p>We however find that princes sometimes endeavoured by
the most effective means to restrain this magnificence. When
Philip II. of France and Richard I. of England, about the
end of the twelfth century, undertook a crusade to the Holy
Land, they resolved that neither of them should wear ermine,
sable, or other costly <span class="locked">furs<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a></span>. It appears that a similar resolution
was adopted by St. Louis (Louis IX.) in the following
century; for the historians, speaking of his crusade, expressly
say that he avoided all magnificence, and wore no costly <span class="locked">furs<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a></span>.
In the year 1336, in the reign of Edward III., king of England,
when foreign articles imported into the kingdom began
to be taxed, it was enacted, that no person whose yearly income<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
did not amount to a hundred pounds should wear furs,
under the penalty of losing <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a></span>.</p>

<p>In Germany, in 1497, citizens who did not belong to the
nobility or equestrian order were forbidden to wear lining of
sable or ermine. According to an ordinance of 1530, common
citizens, tradesmen, and shopkeepers were to wear no
trimmed clothes, nor to use marten or other costly lining, and
the rich were to wear lining made only of lamb-skins, or
those of the cow, fox, weasel, and the like. Merchants and
tradespeople were not to wear marten, sable, or ermine, and
at most weasel-skins; and their wives were to wear the fur
only of the squirrel. Counts and lords were allowed all kinds
of lining, sable and such like expensive kinds excepted. The
latter permission was repeated, word for word, in the year
1548.</p>

<p>When one considers how much the use of fur dresses was
spread all over Europe, it must excite astonishment that they
were not introduced at the court of Byzantium. No traces
of them are to be found in any of the Byzantine historians;
not even in that work in which the emperor Constantine describes
the whole ceremonial of his court, and in which dresses
of various kinds are named, as Reiske has already <span class="locked">remarked<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a></span>.
Furs are nowhere represented on Grecian statues, in paintings,
or other works of art; and it will be seen in the passages
quoted, that in the magnificence which the European princes
displayed in the time of the crusades at the court of Constantinople,
nothing attracted so much attention as the different
kinds of fur dresses. This seems the more astonishing, as a
great trade was carried on at that time between Constantinople
and those countries from which these wares were sent
to Europe.</p>

<p>Over one of the gates of Milan is an image cut out in stone
of the twelfth century, representing an emperor whose mantle
is ornamented with small triangular patches of fur. Flamma
believed that this carving was intended to represent one of
the Greek emperors; but Giulini justly remarks, in opposition
to this opinion, that furs never occur in any of the Greek
sculpture. Besides, that image was evidently formed to ridicule
the emperor, as is proved by the hideous monster seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
close to him. But at that time the Milanese certainly had no
cause to offend the Greek emperor, with whom they were in
alliance; and Giulini has proved, in a very satisfactory manner,
that the Milanese erected this image to ridicule the emperor
Frederick I., who was their bitterest <span class="locked">enemy<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a></span>. On
another image at Milan, cut out in stone, of the thirteenth
century, which represents the emperor of Germany on his
throne, surrounded by the electors, the latter have small
mantles, which are ornamented with triangular patches of
fur of the same <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a></span>.</p>

<p>[Since the discovery and settlement of Canada, furs or
peltries have mostly been obtained from the northern parts
of America, some from the states of Rio de la Plata, a few
from Germany, Holland, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The success obtained by the French after their settlement
in Canada in 1608, induced the formation of the English
Hudson’s Bay Company, which was chartered by Charles II.
in 1670, with the exclusive privilege of trading with the Indians
in the vast territories adjoining Hudson’s Bay. But their
charter never having been confirmed by parliament, hunting
in those regions was still considered as open to all British
subjects, and many engaged in it. In 1766, private adventurers
began to traffic from Michillimakinac, whose success
incited others to follow their example; and independent
traders gradually spread over every part of the country, until
1787, when these scattered parties were united into one great
body, under the name of the “North-west Company.” The
rivalry of these associations had the effect of inspiriting and
extending the trade, and led to constant and furious disturbances
between the two. At length, in 1821, the two concerns
united, under the title of the “Hudson’s Bay Fur Company,”
with much advantage to the peace of the fur countries, and
perhaps to the permanent interests of the trade. The skins
collected by this company are all shipped to London, mostly
from their factories of York Fort and Moose Fort in Hudson’s
Bay; others from Fort Vancouver, on the river Columbia, and
from Montreal.</p>

<p>On the part of the United States, the fur trade is chiefly
prosecuted by the North American Fur Company, whose
principal establishment is at Michillimakinac, where it receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
skins from the posts depending on that station and
from those on the Mississippi, Missouri and Yellowstone rivers,
and the great range of country extending thence to the Rocky
Mountains. Of other associations in the United States, the
most celebrated are Ashley’s Company from St. Louis, and
Captain Bonneville’s, formed at New York in 1831; which
last has pushed its enterprises into tracts between the Rocky
Mountains and the coasts of Monterrey and Upper California.
Indeed the whole of the districts from the Mississippi to the
Pacific, and from the Arctic Sea to the Gulf of Mexico, are
now traversed in every direction by the hunter. Almost all
the American furs which do not belong to the Hudson’s Bay
Company find their way to New York, where they are either
distributed for home consumption, or exported chiefly to
London.</p>

<p>The fur trade is also extensively pursued by the Russians
in the north of Asia and the north-west coast of America.
Their chief association is the Russian American Company of
Moscow; and the principal markets for their furs are the
fairs of Kiachta, Novgorod and Leipsic.</p>

<p>London is the principal emporium of the fur trade: the
vessels of the Hudson’s Bay Company arrive here about September;
the public sales are held in March, and are attended
by a great many foreign merchants, whose purchases
are chiefly sent to the great fairs of Leipsic, whence they are
distributed to various parts of the continent.]</p>

friendship of Professor Eichorn:&mdash;“Of furs being used as dresses of magnificence
I find very faint traces. I shall however quote all the passages
where allusion is made to furs.
</p>
<p>
“In Genesis, chap. xxv. ver. 25, Esau is said to have felt to the touch
like a hairy garment, <span xml:lang="he" lang="he">אדרת שער</span>. A fur dress must here be meant; for
Rebecca endeavoured to make Jacob like his brother, by binding pieces
of goats’ skins around his hands and neck.&mdash;Genesis xxvii. ver. 16.
</p>
<p>
“In Joshua, chap. vii. ver. 21, the true reading is <span xml:lang="he" lang="he">אדות שכער</span>, and signifies
a Babylonian mantle, consequently one made of wool, respecting
which many passages have been collected by various authors, and particularly
Fischer in Prolus. de Vers. Græc. Vet. Test. p. 87. One manuscript,
according to Kennicot, has however <span xml:lang="he" lang="he">אדרת שעו</span>, a hairy mantle or
fur; but this has arisen either through an error in transcribing, one consonant,
<span xml:lang="he" lang="he">נ</span> <i>Nun</i>, being omitted; or from the conjecture of some Jewish
copyist, who was acquainted with costly furs but not with a Babylonian
mantle. If the reading of Kennicot is to be retained, it would, on account
of the price, be an important passage, in regard to costly furs.
</p>
<p>
“Among the Hebrews, the prophets wore fur dresses, if not in general,
at any rate very often.
</p>
<p>
“The mantle of Elijah, 2 Kings, chap. ii. ver. 8, 13, 14, was of fur;
because on account of his clothing he was called a hairy man, 2 Kings,
chap. i. ver. 8.
</p>
<p>
“A hairy mantle, as a mark of distinction, is mentioned in the book of
Zechariah, chap. xiii. ver. 4.
</p>
<p>
“In 1 Maccabees, chap. xiii. ver. 37, the high priest Simon obtained
from king Demetrius <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βαίνη</span>, which is certainly a false reading for <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βαίτα</span>,
or <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βαίτη</span>. The only question is, whether <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βαίτη</span>, which was merely a shepherd’s
dress, consequently made of sheep skins, signified also a dress of
state, as there is reason to conjecture from the persons who sent and who
received it as a present. See Theocrit. Idyll. iii. 25. et ibi Schol. Furs,
as a present, in the hot climate of Bassorah, are mentioned by Niebuhr.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_723" id="Footnote_723" href="#FNanchor_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> The best refutation of this supposed Vandalism is to be found in
Schlözer’s Essay, in the second edition of F. I. L. Mayers Fragmenten aus
Paris. Hamb. 1798, 8vo, ii. p. 353. Nowhere do we find that the works
of art were destroyed by the Goths or Vandals; on the contrary, it appears
that they had sufficient culture to hold them in just estimation.
Genseric carried away works of art from Rome, in the same manner as
the Romans had done from Greece; but they were carefully packed up
and not destroyed; he did therefore what Bonaparte did in those countries
which were unable to withstand the force of his armies. If the epithet
of Vandalism is to be applied to modern events, it seems most applicable
to those who carried away works of art from countries into which
the conquerors promised to introduce the rights of man, liberty, and happiness.
The Christian writers, even, and among these St. Augustine,
admit that the Goths after their victories were not so cruel and rapacious
as the Romans. Orosius, who lived in the beginning of the fifth century,
relates, that a Goth of high rank, after the taking of Rome, having found
in a house some gold and silver vessels which had been plundered from
the church of St. Peter, gave notice to Alaric, and that the latter caused
them to be sent back safe to the church. The account given of the arms
and accoutrements of these northern tribes proves also that they were
acquainted with the arts, and that they employed them to ornament their
clothing. The fur dresses therefore may have been very handsome.</p></div>

in Algem. Welthistor. vol. xxxi. pp. 445, 458.&mdash;Having heard from
M. Schlözer that the first certain traces of the Russian fur trade were to
be found in the Russian Chronicles, works never yet used, I requested him,
as the only person in Germany who could draw from these sources, to
transmit to me what he had remarked on that subject. I am indebted to
him, therefore, for the following valuable information, the result of a
laborious comparison of various manuscript chronicles, for which he will
no doubt receive the reader’s thanks.
</p>
<p>
“The following passages are taken from the ten Russian Chronicles,
the greater part of them still in manuscript, as a proof that from the ninth
century tribute in furs was demanded from the people in Russia by their
conquerors.
</p>
<p>
I. “In the year 859, the Waringians, who came by sea, had tribute from
the Tschudi, the Slavi, the Meri, and the Kriwitsches, a squirrel per man.
The Chazares (in the Crimea) had tribute from the Poles (the inhabitants
of the Ukrain), the Severians and the Wæitsches, a squirrel for each fireplace
or hearth.
</p>
<p>
“The squirrel <i>Sciurus vulgaris</i> had in the old and new Russian language
the five following names:&mdash;1st. ‘Bēla.’ This primitive word has been lost
in the new Russian language, but is still preserved in the Chronicles, and
in the adjectives ‘bēlij’ and ‘bēliczij mēch, Grauwerk’ (squirrel-skins). ‘Bēl’
in all the Sclavonic dialects signifies white. Can any connexion be discovered
between the squirrel and a white colour? 2nd. ‘Bēlka,’ the diminutive
of the former, is at present generally current. 3rd. ‘Wēkscha,’ from
which is derived, 4th. ‘Wēkschitza,’ the diminutive. 5th. ‘Weweritza’
is old, but still exists in the Polish.
</p>
<p>
“The variations of these words which occur in manuscripts are abundant,
and some of them exceedingly laughable. One transcriber has ‘bēla;’
most of the rest add ‘wēkscha,’ ‘wēkschitza’ or ‘weweritza,’ as if ‘bēla’
were the adjective white. Two manuscripts say expressly, ‘bēla,’ that is
‘wēkscha.’ In one, however, from ‘bēla weweritza’ has been made ‘bēla
‘dewitza,’ a fair or beautiful maid.
</p>
<p>
II. “In the year 883 Oleg went against the Drewians and Severians,
whom he obliged to pay tribute, each a black marten.
</p>
<p>
“‘Po czernē kunē’ stands in all the manuscripts; one only has the diminutive
‘kunitzē.’ Another bad manuscript, which has ‘konē,’ a black
horse, is not worthy of any remark.
</p>
<p>
III. “In 969 Svātoslav spoke to his mother and boyars: ‘I am not
fond of Kief; I will reside in Pereyaslawetz on the Danube. There I shall
be in the middle of my lands, to which every thing good in my territories
flows: from the Greeks gold and <i>pavoloki</i> (silk-stuffs?), and wine and fruit
of every kind; from the Tscheches (Bohemians) and Hungarians silver and
horses; from Russia <i>skora</i>, wax, honey, and servants.’ <i>Skora</i>, <i>skura</i>, furs
(according to the Great Lexicon of the Russian Academy), from which is
derived <i>skornak</i>, similar furs prepared. That coarse skins or furs (in
Russian <i>schurka</i>), such as the <i>terga boum</i>, imposed by the Romans on the
Frieslanders, are not here meant, is proved by a passage in the Chronicle
of Nicon, vol. ii. p. 15, where it is related of a savage people, who lived far
to the north on the Ural, that they gave <i>skora</i> for a knife and a hatchet.
</p>
<p>
“That marten-skins, as well as pieces of them (<i>mortki</i>) and of squirrel-skins,
were used as money in Novogorod, till the year 1411, is well-known
from Saml. Russ. Geschichte, vol. v. p. 430.”</p></div>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="steel">STEEL.</h2>

<p>Steel is a carburet of iron, and possesses some remarkable
properties, by which it is distinguished from common iron.
It is of such a superior degree of hardness, that it is capable
of filing the latter; it strikes fire with siliceous stones, and
scratches the hardest glass; it is heavier, emits a stronger
sound, exhibits on fracture a finer grain, assumes a brighter
white lustre when polished, is susceptible of greater elasticity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
becomes more slowly magnetic, but retains that power longer;
does not so easily acquire rust; in the fire it assumes various
strong tints, and when heated is speedily cooled in cold water,
but is then harder, more brittle and less pliable. In consequence
of these qualities it is fit for many uses to which
common iron either cannot be applied, or is less proper.</p>

<p>It is certain that the invention of steel is of very great
antiquity. In the Old Testament, however, the mention
of it is very doubtful, according to Professor Tychsen,
whose remarks on this subject I subjoin in a note <span class="locked">below<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a></span>;
but it appears that it was used as early as the time of Homer,
and that the Greeks gave to it different names, one of the
most common of which was <i>stomoma</i>, though it seems certain
that this word did not so much denote steel itself as the
steeled part of an instrument, or the operation of steeling.
The name <i>chalybs</i> was given to steel from the Chalybes, a
people on the southern shore of the Pontus Euxinus, between
Colchis and Paphlagonia, who had considerable mines, and
in particular iron and steel works: though others, on the
contrary, derive the name of the people from the principal
article of their commerce. This derivation appears the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
probable, as Justin says that a river of Spain, on which there
were steel works, was named <i>Chalybs</i>, but at a much later
period. Some also have ascribed to the Chalybes the invention
of iron, which however is much older.</p>

<p>But it seems to be less known that <i>adamas</i> also at first
denoted steel. This is expressly said by Hesychius, and
many epithets derived from <i>adamas</i> are applied to articles
made of steel or of iron. Among these may be mentioned
the helmet of Hercules, in <span class="locked">Hesiod<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a></span>, and the so-called adamantine
chains, gates, and bars of the poets, which in dictionaries
are always explained as consisting of precious stones.</p>

<p>It was not till a late period that this word was applied to
the most costly of all the precious stones. In this sense it
occurs neither in Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, Orpheus, nor
Dioscorides, though the first of these writers often describes
various kinds of valuable ornaments. Goguet and others
thence conclude that the diamond was not then known. At
present I cannot enter into the history of this stone; but I
must own, that I consider the knowledge of it to be older,
and suspect that it was first introduced under another name,
and is mentioned by Orpheus and some others under that
of jasper (jaspis). This poet compares his jaspis to rock
crystal, and says that it kindles fire in the same manner.
That he knew how to use rock crystal as a burning-glass, he
expressly tells us himself; but he certainly could not procure
a diamond of such a size as to be able to burn with it. From
its vitreous nature however he conjectured, and very properly,
that it might be employed for that purpose. He calls
the jaspis transparent, compares it to glass, and says that it
had that sky colour which at present is named <i>color hyalinus</i>.
This is probably the reason why Dioscorides and others call
some kinds of jasper transparent and sky-coloured. The
jaspis in the Revelation of St. <span class="locked">John<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a></span>, described as a costly
transparent crystalline kind of stone, was perhaps our diamond,
which afterwards was everywhere distinguished by
that name.</p>

<p>The Romans borrowed from the Greeks the word <i>chalybs</i>;
and in consequence of a passage in <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a></span>, many believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
they gave also to steel the name of <i>acies</i>, from which the
Italians made their <i>acciajo</i>, and the French their <i>acier</i>. The
word <i>acies</i>, however, denoted properly the steeled or cutting
part only of an instrument. From this, in later times, was
formed <i>aciarium</i>, for the steel which gave the instrument its
sharpness, and also <i>aciare</i> to <span class="locked">steel<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a></span>.</p>

<p>At present there are two methods of making steel; the
first of which is by fusion either from iron-stone or raw iron,
and the second by cementation. I have never found in the
works of the ancients any traces of steel prepared by cementation;
nor am I acquainted with the antiquity of that process,
though the ancients, without knowing it, employed it
for brass. Spielman <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a></span>, that Pliny in one part calls it
<i>tostio</i>; but this word occurs neither in Pliny nor in any
ancient writer. It is however possible that the word <i>torrere</i>
may somewhere signify cementation, but I have not yet met
with an instance of it.</p>

<p>The preparation however by fusion, as practised by the
Chalybes, has been twice described by Aristotle; but as I
have already given in another <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a></span> everything I was able
to collect towards an explanation of these passages, I shall
not here repeat it. I shall only remark, that the steel of the
ancients, in consequence of not being cemented, suffered itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
to be hammered, and was not nearly so brittle as the
hardest with which we are acquainted at present.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the singular method of preparing steel
employed by the Celtiberians, in Spain, deserves to be here
described. According to the account of <span class="locked">Diodorus<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a></span> and
<span class="locked">Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a></span>, the iron was buried in the earth, and left in that
situation till the greater part of it was converted into rust.
What remained, without being oxydized, was afterwards
forged and made into weapons, and particularly swords, with
which they could cut asunder bones, shields, and helmets.
However improbable this may appear, it is nevertheless the
process still used in Japan; and Swedenborg has introduced
it among the different methods of making <span class="locked">steel<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a></span>.</p>

<p>The art of hardening steel by immersing it suddenly, when
red-hot, in cold water, is very <span class="locked">old<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a></span>. Homer says, that when
Ulysses bored out the eye of Polyphemus with a burning
stake, it hissed in the same manner as water when the smith
immerses in it a piece of red-hot iron, in order to harden <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a></span>.
Sophocles uses the comparison of being hardened like immersed
<span class="locked">iron<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></span>; and <span class="locked">Salmasius<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a></span> quotes a work of an old Greek
chemist, who treats on the method of hardening iron in India.
It is also a very ancient opinion, that the hardening depends
chiefly on the nature of the water. Many rivers and wells
were therefore in great reputation, so that steel works were
often erected near them, though at a considerable distance from
the mines. Instances of this may be found in <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></span> and in
<span class="locked">Justin<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a></span>. The more delicate articles of iron were not quenched
in water, but in oil.</p>

<p>An opinion, it is well known, long prevailed, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
were various fluids and mixtures which communicate to steel
different degrees of hardness, and every artist thought he knew
a peculiar hardening kind of water, the preparation of which
he kept a secret. This notion is by some still <span class="locked">maintained<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a></span>;
because there are often found stones cut by the ancients,
which the moderns, on account of their hardness, as is believed,
have seldom ventured to touch. Of this kind is the
hardest porphyry. There are people who still endeavour to
find out that hardening kind of water, in which the ancients prepared
their tools for cutting such stones. According to <span class="locked">Vasari<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a></span>,
that water was actually discovered by the archduke Cosmo,
in the year 1555. Among a large collection of stones he had
a block of porphyry, from which he wished a bason to be
made for a well, but was told by the most experienced artists
that it was impossible. On this, says Vasari, in order to render
the work possible, he prepared from certain herbs, which
he does not name, a water wherein the red-hot tools were
quenched, and by these means so hardened, that they were
capable of cutting porphyry. With tools tempered in this
manner the artist Francesco del Tadda not only made the required
bason, but various other curious <span class="locked">articles<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a></span>.</p>

<p>Winkelman, therefore, does injustice to Vasari when he
says, “Vasari, in pretending that Cosmo archduke of Tuscany
discovered a water for making porphyry soft, betrays
childish credulity.” On the contrary, he very properly asserts
that there is no water of such a quality as to soften
porphyry; though Porta and many old writers imagined that
they were acquainted with one capable of producing on
that stone, which they considered as a species of marble, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
same effects as an acid does on the latter. But Vasari says
nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>After Tadda’s death, the art of cutting porphyry came to
Raphael Curradi, who communicated to Dominico Corsi this
secret, which was afterwards employed by Cosimo <span class="locked">Silvestrini<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a></span>.
I, however, agree in opinion with Winkelman and Fiorillo,
our learned connoisseur in the arts, that the method of working
porphyry was known in every age, even in the most barbarous,
though artists, no doubt, preferred working on other
stones which were less brittle and hard. We know however
from the latest researches, that all the kinds of hardening
water hitherto invented are in nothing superior to common
water; and that in hardening more depends on the nature of
the steel, or rather on the degree of heat, than on the water;
although it is true that the workman does right when he adds
to the water a thin cake of grease, or pours over it hot oil,
through which the steel must necessarily pass before it enters
the water, for by these means it is prevented from acquiring
cracks and flaws.</p>

<p>The invention of converting bar iron into steel by dipping
it into other fused iron, and suffering it to remain there several
hours, is commonly ascribed to <span class="locked">Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a></span>. But this process
is mentioned by Agricola, Imperati and others, as a thing
well-known and practised in their time.</p>

<p>Pliny, <span class="locked">Daimachus<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a></span> and other ancient writers mention various
countries and places which, in their time, produced excellent
steel. Among the dearest kinds were the <i>ferrum Indicum</i>
and <i>Sericum</i>. The former appears to be the <i>ferrum
candidum</i>, a hundred talents of which were given as a present
to Alexander in <span class="locked">India<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a></span>. Is it not probable that this was
the excellent kind of steel still common in that country, and
known under the name of <i>wootz</i>, some pieces of which were
sent from Bombay in the year 1795 to the Royal Society of
London? Its silver-coloured appearance when polished may
have, perhaps, given occasion to the epithet of <i>candidum</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
The method of preparing it is still unknown, but it is supposed
to be a kind of fused <span class="locked">steel<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a></span>. This however is a mere
conjecture, unsupported by any <span class="locked">proofs<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a></span>. At what time was
damasked steel obtained from the Levant?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
[Three kinds of steel are now principally manufactured;
bar or blistered steel, shear steel and cast steel.</p>

<p>The bar or blistered steel is made by the process of cementation:
this consists in putting bars of the purest malleable
iron alternately with layers of charcoal or soot into a proper
furnace; the air being carefully excluded and the whole kept
at a red heat for several days. By this process the carbon
combines with the iron, altering its texture from fibrous to
granular or crystalline, and rendering the surface blistered.
The action of the carbon occasions fissures and cavities in
the substance of the bars, rendering them unfit for tool-making,
until they are condensed and rendered uniform by the
operation of <i>tilting</i>, i. e. compression by a powerful hammer
worked by machinery.</p>

<p>Shear steel is made by breaking up bars of blistered steel
into lengths of about 18 inches, and binding four or six of
them together with a steel rod, and then heating them to a
full welding heat, the surface being covered with fine clay or
sand to prevent oxidation. They are then drawn out into a bar,
hammered, tilted and rolled. In this state it is susceptible of
a much finer polish, and is also more tenacious and malleable,
and fit for making strong springs, knives, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Cast steel, which was first made by Mr. Huntsman at Attercliff,
Sheffield, in 1770, is made by melting blistered steel,
casting it into ingots and rolling it into bars. In this condition
its texture is much more uniform, closer and finer grained.
The different degrees of hardness required for steel are given
by the process called tempering, which is effected by heating
the steel up to a certain temperature, and then quenching it
suddenly in cold water. Its hardness and brittleness are thus
much increased, but it may be again softened by exposure to
heat simply.]</p>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_806" id="Footnote_806" href="#FNanchor_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> In regard to the hardening of iron and the quenching of it in water,
nothing, as far as I know, occurs in the Hebrew text of the Scriptures.
The passages where it seems to be mentioned are, Isaiah, chap. xliv. ver.
12. “The smith bends the iron, works it in a fire of coals, and forms it
with the hammer; he labours on it with a strong arm,” &amp;c. according to
the translation of Michaelis. It may indeed be translated otherwise, but
it certainly alludes to the formation of an image of metal. The words,
chap. liv. ver. 16, are still more general.
</p>
<p>
Iron, <i>barzel</i>, often occurs, and in some passages indeed steel may be
understood under this name; for example, in Ezekiel, chap. xxvii. ver.
19, <i>ferrum fabrefactum</i>, or, according to Michaelis and others, sabre
blades from Usal (Sanaa in Yemen). A pretty clear indication of steel is
given in Jeremiah, chap. xv. ver. 12: “Iron from the north,” which is described
there as the hardest. To the north of Judæa was situated Chalybia,
the ancient country of steel. It appears that the Hebrews had no
particular name for steel, which they perhaps comprehended under the
term <i>barzel</i>, or distinguished it only by the epithet Northern, especially
as the later Jews have for it no other name than <span xml:lang="he" lang="he">אסטמא</span>, <i>istoma</i>, which
however is nothing else than the Greek <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">στόμωμα</span>, and signifies rather
steeling or hardening.
</p>
<p>
<i>Chalamisch</i> is certainly a hard kind of stone; granite or porphyry, according
to Michaelis, who treats expressly of it in Supplem. ad Lex.
Hebr. N. 740.</p></div>

differentia est; nucleus quidem ferri excoquitur in his ad indurandam
aciem; aliquæ modo ad densandas incudes, malleorumve rostra.” According
to my opinion, <i>stricturæ</i> was the name given to pieces of steel completely
manufactured and brought to that state which rendered them fit
for commerce. At present steel comes from Biscay in cakes, from other
places in bars, and both these formerly were called <i>stricturæ</i>, because
they were employed chiefly for giving sharpness to instruments or tools,
that is, for steeling them. In speaking of other metals, Pliny says that
the finished productions at the works were not called <i>stricturæ</i> (this was
the case, for example, with copper), though sharpness could be given to
instruments with other metals also. The words of Pliny last quoted are
read different ways, and still remain obscure. I conjecture that he meant
to say that some steel works produced things which were entirely of
steel, and that others were employed only in steeling. I shall here remark
that the <i>stricturæ ferri</i> remind us of the <i>strigiles auri</i>: such was
the name given to native pieces of gold, which without being smelted were
used in commerce.&mdash;Plin. xxxiii. 3. p. 616.</p></div>

or Indian steel, by the natives at the present day, is probably the very
same that was practised by them at the time of the invasion of Alexander;
and it is a uniform process, from the Himalaya Mountains to Cape Comorin.
The furnace or bloomery in which the ore is smelted, is from four
to five feet high; it is somewhat pear-shaped, being about two feet wide
at bottom and one foot at top; it is built entirely of clay, so that a couple
of men may finish its erection in a few hours, and have it ready for use
the next day. There is an opening in front about a foot or more in
height, which is built up with clay at the commencement, and broken down
at the end, of each smelting operation. The bellows are usually made of a
goat’s skin, which has been stripped from the animal without ripping open
the part covering the belly. The apertures at the legs are tied up, and a
nozzle of bamboo is fastened in the opening formed by the neck. The
orifice of the tail is enlarged and distended by two slips of bamboo. These
are grasped in the hand, and kept close together in making the stroke for
the blast; in the returning stroke they are separated to admit the air.
By working a bellows of this kind with each hand, making alternate
strokes, a tolerably uniform blast is produced. The bamboo nozzles of
the bellows are inserted into tubes of clay, which pass into the furnace at
the bottom corners of the temporary wall in front. The furnace is filled
with charcoal, and a lighted coal being introduced before the nozzles, the
mass in the interior is soon kindled. As soon as this is accomplished, a
small portion of the ore, previously moistened with water, to prevent it
from running through the charcoal, but without any flux whatever, is laid
on the top of the coals, and covered with charcoal to fill up the furnace.
In this manner ore and fuel are supplied, and the bellows are urged for
three or four hours, when the process is stopped, and the temporary wall
in front broken down; the bloom is removed with a pair of tongs from
the bottom of the furnace. In converting the iron into steel, the natives
cut it into pieces to enable it to pack better in the crucible, which is
formed of refractory clay, mixed with a large quantity of charred husk of
rice. It is seldom charged with more than a pound of iron, which is put
in with a proper weight of dried wood, chopped small, and both are covered
with one or two green leaves; the proportions being in general ten parts
of iron to one of wood and leaves. The mouth of the crucible is then
stopped with a handful of tempered clay, rammed in very closely, to exclude
the air. As soon as the clay plugs of the crucibles are dry, from
twenty to twenty-four of them are built up in the form of an arch in a
small blast furnace; they are kept covered with charcoal, and subjected
to heat urged by a blast for about two hours and a half, when the process
is considered to be complete. The crucibles being now taken out of the
furnace and allowed to cool, are broken, and the steel is found in the form
of a cake, rounded by the bottom of the crucible.&mdash;Ure’s Dictionary of

<h2 id="stamping" title="STAMPING-WORKS">STAMPING-WORKS<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor smaller">831</a>.</h2>

<p>In order to separate metallic ores from the barren rock or
stones with which they occur, and to promote their fusion, it
is necessary that the pieces of rock or stone should be reduced
to small fragments by stamping them. For those ores
which occur in a sandy form, this is unnecessary; and in regard
to rich silver ore, which contains very little or no lead and
other metals, this process might be hurtful; for with dry stamping
a great deal would fly off in dust, and with wet stamping
a considerable part would be washed away by the water.</p>

<p>However imperfect the knowledge of the ancients may
have been in regard to the fusion of ores, they were acquainted
with the benefit of stamping; but the means they
employed for that purpose were the most inconvenient and
expensive. They reduced the ore to coarse powder, by
pounding it in mortars, and then ground it in hand-mills, like
those used for corn, till it acquired such a degree of fineness
that it could be easily washed. This is proved by the scanty
information which we find in Diodorus <span class="locked">Siculus<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a></span> and <span class="locked">Agatharcides<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a></span>,
in regard to the gold mines of the Egyptians; in
Hippocrates, respecting the smelting-works of the <span class="locked">Greeks<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a></span>,
and in Pliny in regard to the metallurgy of the <span class="locked">Romans<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a></span>.
Remains of such mortars and mills as were used by the ancients
have been found in places where they carried on metallurgic
operations; for instance, in Transylvania and the
Pyrenees. The hand-mills had a resemblance to our <span class="locked">mustard-mills<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a></span>;
and for washing the mud they employed a sieve, but
in washing auriferous sand they made use of a raw hide.
From the latter, Count von Veltheim has explained, in a very
ingenious manner, the fable of the ancients concerning the
ants which dug up <span class="locked">gold<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Our works for pounding ore, at present, are stamping-mills,
which consist of heavy stampers shod with iron. These
stampers are put in motion by a cylinder furnished with cogs,
which is driven by a water-wheel, and pound the ore in
troughs lined with iron. When the ore subjected to this
operation is poor, water is introduced into the troughs, which
running through grates in the bottoms of them, carries with
it the pounded matter into a gutter, where it becomes purified,
and deposits the mud mixed with sand.</p>

<p>One might conjecture that this apparatus was invented soon
after the invention of cylinders with cogs; but this was not
the case, though I am not able to determine the antiquity of
these cylinders. At any rate, it is certain that mortars and
sieves were used in Germany throughout the whole of the
fifteenth century; and in France, to which the art of mining
was conveyed in general from that country at a late period,
they were still employed about the year <span class="locked">1579<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a></span>. In the oldest
times men were not acquainted with the art of employing
water at mines in so advantageous a manner as at present.
The bellows were worked by men; and those aqueducts
raised on posts, by which distant water may be made to act
on machines, was not yet invented. On this account, remains
of ore are found in places where the moderns, in consequence
of that indispensable article water, would not be able to maintain
metallurgic <span class="locked">works<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a></span>. According to the researches which
I have hitherto had an opportunity to make, our stamping-mills
were invented about the beginning of the sixteenth century,
and, as appears, in Germany; but I cannot determine
with certainty either the name of the inventor or his country.
Those who established or introduced the first stamping-works
in Saxony and the Harz are only mentioned; and these, as
usual, have been considered as the inventors.</p>

<p>In the year 1519 the processes of sifting and wet-stamping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
were established in Joachimsthal by Paul Grommestetter, a native
of Schwarz, named on that account the Schwarzer, whom
Melzer praises as an ingenious and active washer; and we
are told that he had before introduced the same improvements
at Schneeberg. Soon after, that is in 1521, a large stamping-work
was erected at Joachimsthal, and the process of washing
was begun. A considerable saving was thus made, as a great
many metallic particles were before left in the washed sand,
which was either thrown away or used as mortar for building.
In the year 1525 Hans Pörtner employed at Schlackenwalde
the wet method of stamping, whereas before that period the
ore there was ground.</p>

<p>In the Harz this invention was introduced at Wildenmann
by Peter Philip, who was assay-master there, soon after the
works at the Upper Harz were resumed by Duke Henry the
younger about the year 1524. This we learn from the papers
of Herdan Hacke or Hæcke, who was preacher at Wildenmann
in 1572. As far as can be concluded from his imperfect
information, the first stamping-work there consisted only
of a stamper raised by means of two levers fixed to the axis
of a wheel. The pounded ore was then thrown into a sieve,
called in German the <i>sachs</i><a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a>, and freed from the coarser
parts. But as this stamping was performed in the dry manner,
it produced so much dust that the labourers were impeded by
it, and the ore on that account could not be properly smelted.
The business however was not given up; new improvements
were made, and soon after Simon Krug and Nicholas Klerer
introduced the wet method, and fortunately brought it to
<span class="locked">perfection<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is said in several modern works that wet stamping was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
invented in 1505, by a Saxon nobleman named von Maltitz.
This assertion has been so often repeated, that it was known
to <span class="locked">Gobet<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a></span>, who adopted it as truth. I have not however been
able to find the historian on whose testimony it is founded;
but it appears by Gauhen’s Dictionary of Nobility that Sigismund
Maltitz was chief surveyor of forests at the Erzgebürge,
to the electorate of Saxony in the sixteenth century.</p>

<h2 id="kitchen">KITCHEN VEGETABLES.</h2>

<p>The greater part of our kitchen vegetables, that is to say
those plants which, independently of the corn kinds, are cultivated
as food in our gardens, are partly indigenous and
partly foreign. Of the former many at present grow wild,
such as asparagus; but by continued cultivation, through a
long series of years, they have produced numerous varieties,
which differ as much from the wild plants as the European
females from those of New Zealand. Many of our indigenous
vegetables are collected for food, but are not reared expressly
for that purpose; and these even, in all probability, might be
improved by culture. Some indeed are here and there reared
in an artificial manner, though we reckon them among our
weeds; for example, dandelion, <i>Leontodon taraxacum</i>, the
first leaves of which in spring are employed in the northern
countries as salad. In some parts of England this plant is
sown throughout the whole summer; and its leaves being
blanched, it is used in winter as endive. Culture frees many
plants from their harsh taste, makes them tender, larger and
more pulpy, and produces them at a season when the wild
ones have become unfit for use.</p>

<p>Our foreign kitchen vegetables have, for the most part,
been procured from the southern countries, but chiefly from
Italy; and the number of them has increased in an uncommon
degree in the course of the last two centuries. Many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
require laborious attention to make them thrive in our severe
climate. On the other hand, some grow so readily, and increase
so much without culture, even in the open fields, that
they have become like indigenous weeds, as is the case with
hops, which at present abound in our hedges. Some plants,
however, both indigenous and foreign, which were formerly
raised by art and used at the table, are no longer cultivated,
because we have become acquainted with others more beneficial.
Many of them served our forefathers in the room of
foreign spices, to the use of which trading companies have
accustomed us, much to their advantage and to our hurt. It
is true also that many have been banished merely by fashion;
for this tyrant, which rules with universal sway, commands
the taste as well as the smell to consider as intolerable articles
to which our ancestors had a peculiar attachment.</p>

<p>In the oldest times mankind were so fond of sweet things,
that the goodness and agreeable taste of every kind of food
was determined according to the degree of its sweetness;
and such is the manner of judging even at present throughout
all the East, in Africa, and in America. This is the case
also among us with the greater part of the lower classes, who
are not able to follow the mode of richer tables. In the
northern countries this taste is almost everywhere prevalent.
Thus the Swedes spoil, by the addition of sugar, costly Rhenish
wine, sour kraut, and other articles, the agreeable tartness
of which is gratifying to other nations. In proportion
to their population and luxury, the Swedes seem to use more
sugar than the Germans, and the Germans more than the
English or French; and one might almost suspect that a
taste for sweet things were in the inverse ratio of <span class="locked">civilization<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a></span>.
At any rate, one can thus explain why many vegetable
productions, which some centuries ago were reckoned among
the most agreeable dishes, appear to us to be nauseously
sweet. Skirret, which the emperor Tiberius caused to be
brought for the use of his table from the Rhine, is little
relished at present; and the case is the same with parsnips,
some kinds of apples, and several other things.</p>

<p>Fashion sometimes recalls into use species long forgotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
and with the greatest success, when they are introduced under
a different name. Thus, after an interval of many years,
some began to cultivate again <span class="locked">monks-rhubarb<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a></span>, and to recommend
this sourish plant instead of the more savoury spinage.
According to Bock, it was transplanted in the middle ages
by the monks from the woods into gardens, to which it has
been again brought back under the imposing appellation of
English spinage.</p>

<p>Before the commencement of the Christian æra, when the
use of sensual enjoyments was not so well-regulated and modified
by religious and political principles, many vegetables
and other dishes were praised and recommended by writers
on agriculture and cookery, as well as by the most favourite
poets and eminent authors, on account of effects which cannot
at present be named, except in the writings of physicians,
without disgusting the reader and incurring the imputation
of indelicacy. When this mode of thinking began to prevail,
people detested to see in their gardens or on their tables
plants which, in consequence of indecent properties, were
generally known; and by being thus disused, the knowledge
of them was at length so much lost, that we know only their
old names, and what the ancients have related respecting
them. In this manner, many receipts in Apicius are totally
unintelligible, because we are no longer acquainted with the
things for the preparation of which he gives directions. Of
this kind are the numerous bulbous roots (<i>bulbi</i>), which
formed the most favourite dishes of the Greeks and the
Romans, and which at present no botanist, much less commentator,
would be able to determine. They belong to the
lost arts, but not to those which were abandoned because
better ones were found to supply their place. The American
vanilla, which perhaps was indebted only to its high price for
the permission of being mixed with chocolate, does not certainly
supply the place of the ancient Megarean bulbs, as our
gunpowder does that of the Greek fire.</p>

<p>Among those kitchen vegetables which were formerly cultivated,
but at present are no more esteemed, are the following:&mdash;Winter-cresses<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a>,
an indigenous plant, the young
leaves of which, like water-cresses, may be eaten in winter as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
salad; also common <span class="locked">alexanders<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a></span>, which in the seventeenth
century was used instead of celery; bulbous chærophyllum<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a>,
the roots of which are still brought to market at Vienna,
where people well know what is good, and where they are
boiled and eaten as salad with vinegar and oil. <span class="locked">Rampion<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a></span>
was formerly used in the like manner. The <span class="locked">earth-nut<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a></span>, which
grows wild in many parts of Germany, is still cultivated in
Holland and in some districts on the Rhine. Rocket (<i>Eruca
sativa</i>), the young leaves of which were readily eaten by our
forefathers as salad, is no longer esteemed, partly on account
of its harsh taste, and partly on account of its nauseous smell,
which resembles that of rancid bacon; it has however been
still retained in Italy, “excitet ut Veneri tardos eruca <span class="locked">maritos<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a></span>.”
Vetches (<i>Lathyrus sativus</i>, and <i>Cicer</i>) are now banished from
our gardens, as experience has shown that they are prejudicial
to the health. When pepper was so dear, that to promise a
saint yearly a pound of it was considered as a liberal bequest,
economical housewives seasoned their dishes with the leaves
of pepper-wort (<i>Lepidium latifolium</i>), which on this account
is called at present in England <i>poor man’s pepper</i>.</p>

<p>Borage (<i>Borago officinalis</i>), since the fourteenth, or at
least the fifteenth century, has been sown not only for medicinal
purposes, but for the use of the kitchen. The young
leaves, which however soon become hard, rough, and unfit
for the table, were used in soup, and the beautiful blue
flowers were put into salad and wine. This plant was not
known to the ancients; for the conjecture that it was what
they called <i>buglossum</i>, is not very probable. As far as I
have been able to learn, Nicholas Myrepsus, who lived in the
beginning of the fourteenth century, is the first who uses the
name <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">πουράκιον</span>, which certainly means <i>borago</i>. But who
knows whence this writer, who introduces in his works a
great many new inexplicable names, some of them formed
from the Greek, Latin, and Italian, obtained that appellation?
Some of the old botanists have conjectured that it is derived
from the word <i>corago</i>, which Apuleius, whose period is uncertain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
gives as a synonym of <i>buglossum</i>. Some think that
the reading in Apuleius ought to be <i>borago</i>; and others
assert that <i>corago</i> is the true name, and arose from the quality
which the plant has of strengthening the heart; consequently
we ought properly to read <i>corago</i>, and not <i>borago</i><a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a>.
It is probable that our forefathers, under the idea that their
borage was the <i>buglossum</i> of the ancients, and therefore had
the property of strengthening the heart, threw the flowers
into wine, that their spirits might by these means be more
enlivened. Our borage is certainly a foreign plant, and
Cæsalpinus said that it was brought from other countries to
Italy. Linnæus<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> positively states that it first came from
Aleppo; but I have not yet been able to find on what authority
this assertion is founded. At present borage, at least
in the German cookery, is no longer used.</p>

<p>Among the kitchen vegetables of which no certain traces
are to be found in the works of the ancients, is spinage (<i>Spinacea
oleracea</i>). Its native country is unknown; but the
name is new, and certainly derived from the nature of its
prickly seeds. As far as I know, it first occurs in the year
1351, among the food used by the monks on <span class="locked">fast-days<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a></span>; and
at that time it was <i>Spinargium</i> or <i>Spinachium</i>. Meursius
found in the middle ages <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σπινάκιον</span>, in a poem which he has
often mentioned, but not defined with sufficient <span class="locked">accuracy<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a></span>.
This plant seems to have been made known from Spain; for
many of the old botanists, such for example as Bock, call it
<i>olus Hispanicum</i>. Ruellius and others name it <i>Atriplex
Hispaniensis</i>; and the latter adds, that the Arabians or
Moors called it <i>Hispanach</i>, which signifies Spanish plant; it
is however well known that formerly everything foreign was
styled Spanish. None of the kitchen vegetables of the ancients
seem to approach nearer to spinage than their <i>Blitum</i>,
which Rondolet considered to be the same. But all the properties
assigned to this vegetable production, namely, that it
was insipid, and that on this account it was necessary to
render it palatable by the addition of vinegar, pepper, and
other things; that it readily multiplied; that it was indigestible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
and gently aperient; perfectly correspond, not only
with our spinage, but with many other plants, such, for example,
as our beet and orach, and the good king Henry
(<i>Chenopodium bonus Henricus</i>), the young leaves of which
are still dressed as spinage. It is also possible that the <i>blitum</i>
of the ancients may have been a kind of <i>Amaranthus</i>, some
species of which are certainly eatable. <i>Blitum</i>, therefore,
will remain as difficult to be defined as the <i>malva</i>, which was
used at the same time.</p>

<p>The <i>Brassicæ</i> of the ancients belonged certainly to the
cabbage genus; yet no one, as far as I know, has examined
botanically what is said of them, and completely proved their
identity. It would however be fruitless labour to attempt to
apply our modern names to the cabbage kinds of the ancients,
and search out in the writings of the Greeks and the Romans
those which we use at present; for by continued culture,
through so many ages and in so many countries, new varieties
have from time to time arisen, and old ones must have
become lost; so that it is impossible for us to have all the varieties
of the ancients, as it was for them to be acquainted
with the whole of those produced in our times. I cannot
therefore venture to assert that we still possess that kind of
cabbage which the ancients, to prevent intoxication, ate raw
like <span class="locked">salad<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a></span>. We can dress in this manner cabbage heads
when they are chopped fine, but we do not know with certainty
whether the ancients were acquainted with our cabbage;
though Ruellius, not without probability, considered
as such that species which in the time of Pliny was known
under the name of <i>lacuturris</i><a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a>.</p>

<p>But even if this be admitted as true, we nowhere find any
traces of that excellent preparation of cabbage called by the
Germans sour kraut; though the ancients were acquainted
with the art of preparing turnips in the same <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a></span>. I
should have been inclined to consider sour kraut as a German
invention, first made in Lower Saxony, which our neighbours
learnt from us in modern times, had not <span class="locked">Bellon<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a></span>
related that the Turks are accustomed to pickle cabbage for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
winter food. It appears, however, that these people take the
whole heads, as in Germany, but particularly in Upper more
than Lower Saxony, some preserve <i>kumskohl</i>, a name which,
as well as <i>compost</i> and the French word <i>compote</i>, Frisch derives
with great probability from <i>compositum</i> (preserved).</p>

<p>The ancients were acquainted with curled cabbage, and
even with some of those kinds which we call <i>broccoli</i>. Under
this term is understood all those species, the numerous young
flowery heads of which, particularly in spring and autumn,
can be used like cauliflowers. Such young shoots are called
<i>cymæ</i>, but not <i>turiones</i>; for the latter term denotes the first
shoots that arise, like those of hops, asparagus, and other
esculent plants. The <i>broccoli</i> used at present was however
first brought from Italy to France, together with the name,
about the end of the sixteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a></span>.</p>

<p>Our cauliflower, about the end of the same century, was
first brought from the Levant to Italy; and in the end of the
seventeenth was transplanted thence to Germany. For a
long time the seeds were procured annually from Cyprus,
Candia, and Constantinople, by the Venetians and Genoese,
who sent them to every part of Europe, because at that time
the art of raising seed was not <span class="locked">understood<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a></span>. Prosper Alpinus,
in the year 1588, found abundance of this vegetable in Egypt,
and from his account there is reason to conjecture that it was
then very little known in Europe. Conrad Gesner seems not
to have been acquainted with it; at any rate it is not mentioned
by him in a list of the cabbage kind of <span class="locked">plants<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a></span>. Even
in the time of Bauhin it must have belonged to those vegetables
which were scarce; because he has been so particular
in naming the garden in which he saw it. Von Hohberg,
who wrote about 1682, says that cauliflower, a few years before,
had been brought to Germany for the first <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></span>.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to define all the species of the cabbage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
kind, the leaves and flowers of which were used by the ancients
as food; but it would be a task still more arduous to
determine those which have esculent roots. To render this
clear, and to show what information I have been able to
obtain on the subject by my researches, I must venture to
indulge in a little botanical criticism. Our plant-connoisseurs
have unfortunately not yet condescended to examine the
class of kitchen vegetables; though it would certainly be
rendering a far greater service to botany, and promote its
utility much more, to describe and delineate all the species,
varieties, and deviations, than to give new names to a dozen
of new genera from Polynesia. According to the Linnæan
system, we have at present the following species of the cabbage,
which have been adopted by all botanists, without further
observation.</p>

<p>First, <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, to which belong all those kinds the
leaves and flowers of which are eaten. It is certainly probable
that all these have been gradually produced from one parent
stock, which it is now impossible perhaps to find in its original
wild state. A similarity is remarked between all these
kinds; and with a little ingenuity one might form a genealogical
tree of them, as Buffon has done in regard to the race
of dogs; but a genealogical tree without proofs is of as
little value in natural history as in claims for hereditary
titles or estates. At present, in our system, we must admit
that such plants as always grow up from their seeds, without
variation, and do not pass into other forms, are peculiar
species; but this will not prove that these supposed species
were not originally produced from one maternal stem; for
the variation of the succeeding plants took place gradually;
and the later ones always deviated more and more from the
parent stock. Who knows how many steps and gradations
were necessary before cabbage, savoys, and cauliflower were
produced from our common colewort? Not fewer, perhaps,
than were required to produce white men from Moors, or
the terrier and lap-dog from the bull-dog.</p>

<p>I shall call the mother plant, or original species, A, which
by unknown causes has produced B, and the latter by continued
and frequently changed culture has become C; from
this has been produced D, and from this E, and from this F,
&amp;c. Now as we are unacquainted with the art of changing A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
into F, and F into A, we believe that F is a species really
different from A. As we here compare two distant links of
a chain, the various parts of which increase very gradually,
we find them so different, that it is impossible for us to consider
them as the same. But sometimes, perhaps, F changes
again into E; E into D; D into C; and C into B or into A.
Perhaps also B may be again produced from A, or F from E.
Had a botanist observed this by experience, he probably
would have no hesitation to consider B, C, D, E, and F as
varieties of A. But such observations seldom occur; we
have not the power of making them according to our pleasure,
for we do not know all the causes by which these numerous
variations are produced. The few observations which have
been made no one has yet collected, compared, and employed
for establishing any certain conclusions. The division, therefore,
of the cultivated plants into species and varieties would
be a fruitless and uncertain undertaking, respecting which
one ought not to dispute without sufficient proofs.</p>

<p>It is needless to refer to the form, colour, smell, and taste
of the leaves, flowers, and roots. That the indented leaves,
such as those which all the cabbage species have, are most
liable to change, is shown by experience. The colour is no
less variable; and Reichard, who had a great belief in the
perpetuity of the species of plants, asserts, that in the same
country and climate he could produce from the seeds of red
cabbage and black radishes, white cabbage and white <span class="locked">radishes<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a></span>.
The production and change of the hermaphrodite
plants is so well known that it is only necessary to mention
them. The smell, for example; but the musky smell of cabbage
establishes no essential difference. Nay, a plant may
entirely lose its odorous principle, <i>spiritus rector</i>, and yet retain
its old form, as well as all its other component parts and
<span class="locked">properties<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a></span>. In sandy soil the smell of plants is often entirely
lost; and the taste is frequently changed, according to the
nature of the land and the manure. The most powerful
medicinal plants are those which grow wild in their native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
country, and not those reared in rich gardens, where many
poisonous plants become eatable. Even the duration does
not always determine the difference of the species. Thus it
is certain that winter and summer rape are the same plants,
though the former is a biennial and the latter an annual.
Where then are the proofs in regard to the cabbage kind,
and, in general, those which show that different plants are
species of one genus, and others only varieties? Precision
or certainty in systems can be expected only by novices; but
in botany the case is the same as in every other science, mathematics
excepted; the more we learn, the more uncertainty
we discover, and the more circumscribed is the real knowledge
which we acquire. It is necessary that this should be known
to those who may take the trouble to examine the history of
kitchen vegetables and other œconomical plants; and therefore
I shall offer no apology for having entered into this
botanical disquisition.</p>

<p>To the <i>Brassica oleracea</i> belong two plants which are used
in the same manner as turnips or roots. The first is the
turnip-cabbage, <i>kohlrabi</i> above the earth (<i>Brassica gongylodes</i>),
the stem of which swells out, above the earth, into a
thick pulpy turnip-like tubercle, which is dressed and eaten
in the same manner as turnips. It is a monstrous excrescence
of the stem, which is hereditary, like the broad stem of the
Italian fennel. This turnip-cabbage was certainly not known
to the ancients; it occurs for the first time among the botanists
of the sixteenth century. Spielmann conjectures that
it was brought from the Levant during the crusades; but it
was known at too late a period to warrant this opinion.</p>

<p>Still newer is that variety called <i>kohlrabi</i>, subterranean or
turnip-rooted cabbage, the stem of which produces a similar
tubercle at the surface of the earth or immediately under it.
In my opinion, it was first described by Caspar Bauhin, in
the year 1620, under the name <i>napo-brassica</i>, which it still
retains, as a new species, to which he was not able to assign
any synonyms. He says that this turnip was cultivated on
the Bohemian frontiers, where it was called <i>Dorsen</i> or <i>Dorschen</i>;
and the same name is given to it there at present, as
is confirmed by Mehler, in whose work there is a good figure
of <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a></span>. In Germany it is commonly called <i>Steckrübe</i>, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
as is said, was first made known there about the year 1764
by the Bohemian glass-dealers.</p>

<p>The second cabbage species in the Linnæan system is the
<i>Brassica napus</i>, a plant which grows wild on the sandy sea-coasts
of England, as well as in the island of Gothland, and
which in many of the northern countries is cultivated for the
oil obtained from the seeds, under the name of winter and
summer rape. When thinly planted in a nourishing soil it
produces esculent roots, which have a somewhat harsh taste,
and properly in German it ought to be called <i>Steckrübe</i>. Such
is the name given to it in the works of all the old writers by
whom it was first mentioned; and it is called so at present in
Bohemia, where it is cultivated, as well as <i>kohlrabi</i> under the
earth, which in some parts of Germany is improperly named
<i>Steckrübe</i>, and a proper distinction is made between the two
<span class="locked">species<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a></span>. This kind, the real <i>Steckrübe</i>, is never very thick,
being only of the size of those which grow in the Mark. The
leaves arise immediately from the roots, but in the <i>gongylodes</i>
and <i>napo-brassica</i> they proceed from the stem.</p>

<p>This species of turnip I did not expect to find among the
ancients. I conceived that it might perhaps have been produced
in the northern countries, since rape began to be cultivated
for oil. Afterwards this plant may have become so
much domesticated among us, as to be found not unfrequently
in a wild state. Some person may then have easily remarked
the pulpy roots of plants growing in a manured soil, and
making a trial of them found them well-tasted. When first
cultivated, it must have been observed that their harsh taste
was moderated, sometimes more and sometimes less, in a sandy
soil, and rendered in some degree aromatic; by which means
they acquired so great a superiority to the common and almost
insipid rape, that they were brought to the first-rate
tables under the name of the Markish, Teltow, Borsfeld,
Bobenhäuser and Wilhelmsburg rapes. In each country they
were named after those places where they acquired the best
savour; and this was the case only where the soil consisted
of clay mixed with more or less sand. From such districts
large quantities of them were sent to a great distance; but
perhaps never in more abundance than from Teltow, in the
Middle Mark, which small town sold to the amount of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
than two thousand dollars, chiefly to Berlin and Hamburg;
and from Hamburg these agreeable roots were frequently
sent to both the Indies. Around Stendal also, in the Old
Mark, they were raised in considerable quantity, but the
seeds are procured there from <span class="locked">Teltow<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a></span>. If we wish to introduce
them into our gardens, we must either mix much sand
with the soil, or procure fresh seeds annually.</p>

<p>The Greeks and the Romans had little occasion for cultivating
rape. They had other vegetables, from the seeds or
fruit of which they could obtain a better oil, and in more
abundance. Where the olive would not thrive, they cultivated,
as at present, sesamum; or expressed oil from the nuts
and seeds of the turpentine <span class="locked">tree<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a></span>, without speaking of the
many essential oils which they used for salves.</p>

<p>But however probable this may appear, I am inclined to
suspect, that under <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">βουνιὰς</span> and <i>napus</i> our <i>steckrüben</i> are to
be understood, as most of the old botanists have admitted;
and that the roots of them were used for food, before the seeds
were employed for making oil. The <i>napus</i> of the ancients
had long thin roots, which were so small that they could be
preserved without being cut into slices; on the other hand,
the <i>rapa</i> had large conical roots, which could not be preserved
till they were sliced. The <i>napus</i>, because the roots grew
chiefly downwards, were sown thicker than the <i>rapum</i>. The
<i>napus</i> was cultivated only for the use of man; but the <i>rapum</i>
was raised in great abundance as fodder for cattle. Of the
<i>napus</i> there were many known varieties, of different degrees
of goodness, which, as is the case at present with <i>steckrüben</i>,
were named from the place where they chiefly grew. When
sown late in the season, they were injured by the earth-flea;
to prevent which, the young plants were strewed over with
soot. Both the <i>napi</i> and <i>rapa</i> were buried in the earth,
where they were kept in a fresh state during the winter. The
former, to prevent them from degenerating, required careful
cultivation; and indeed there are few kitchen vegetables
which so easily change their state, according to the nature of
the soil, as the <i>steckrüben</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
But what opinion can be formed of the assertion, often repeated,
that <i>brassica napus</i>, and <i>rapum</i>, or <i>rapa</i>, readily
change into each other; consequently are only varieties or
deviations of the same <span class="locked">species<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a></span>? I am not disposed to declare
this assertion to be altogether false; though I will not
vouch for the possibility of converting our Markish rapes into
turnips or cabbage. I conjecture that in the oldest times,
when these three plants were not so far separated from each
other by intermediate species or degrees of degeneration, as
they had a greater resemblance to each other, and were all
nearer to the original species, such transitions were easier
than they possibly could be at present.</p>

<p>The third species of cabbage in the Linnæan system, belonging
to this place, is the <i>Brassica rapa</i>, or turnip, the
roots of which, more or less conical, differ in figure, colour
and <span class="locked">taste<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a></span>. That these roots are the same as those called by
the Romans <i>rapa</i>, and by the Greeks <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">γογγύλη</span> or <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">γογγυλὶς</span>,
appears to be subject to no doubt, though at present we may
have a greater number of varieties.</p>

<p>[The turnip was well-known to the Romans, and all that
can be gathered on this subject from the writings of the
ancients renders it probable that it occupied nearly the same
place in Roman culture as it does in British husbandry at
the present day. <span class="locked">Columella<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a></span> recommended that the growth
of turnips should be abundant, because those which were not
required for human food could be given with much advantage
to cattle; and both he and Pliny concur in their testimony,
that this produce was esteemed next to corn in utility and
value. The best grew in the country of the Sabines, and
were worth at Rome a sestertius, or 2<i>d.</i> <span class="locked">each<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is stated that the Roman method of cultivation must
have been superior to that of the moderns, since Pliny relates
that some single roots weighed as much as forty pounds, a
weight far surpassing any which has been obtained by the
most skilful modern agriculturists. It is very probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
the garden culture of the turnip was introduced by the
Romans into this country, and that, like some of the fruit
trees which they had transplanted here, though neglected, it
was never altogether lost. There is no doubt that this root
was in cultivation in the sixteenth century. Whether revived
by native industry, or introduced at that period by the Flemings,
is a question differently answered by different writers.
Towards the latter end of the sixteenth century it is mentioned
by more than one writer. Cogan, in his Haven of
Health, published in 1597, says, that “although many men
love to eat turnips, yet do swine abhor them.” Gerarde,
who published in the same year, and who had rather more
rational views on the subject of plants, leads us to conclude
that more than one variety was cultivated in the environs of
London at that time. “The small turnips,” says he, “grown
by a village near London, called Hackney, in a sandie ground,
and brought to the crosse in Cheapside by the women of the
village to be solde, are the best that I ever tasted.” Gerarde
is silent concerning the field culture of turnips; neither is
this mentioned by Parkinson, who wrote in 1629. We do
not find any account of the root being grown in any part of
the country until the close of the seventeenth century (<i>loc.
sup. citat.</i>). Turnips sometimes attain a very large size in
this country; <span class="locked">Tull<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a></span> speaks of some weighing as much as
nineteen pounds, and of often meeting with others of sixteen
pounds. One was dug up in Surrey, in July 1828, which
weighed twenty-one pounds, and was one yard in <span class="locked">circumference<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a></span>.
Our more immediate ancestors appear to have
applied the turnip to more extensive uses as an esculent than
is done at present. It is stated, that in 1629 and 1630, when
there was a dearth in England, very good, white, lasting and
wholesome bread was made of boiled turnips, deprived of
their moisture by pressure, and then kneaded with an equal
quantity of wheaten flour. The same was had recourse to in
Essex in <span class="locked">1693<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a></span>.]</p>

<p>The question whether the Greeks and the Romans were
acquainted with our <span class="locked">carrots<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a></span>, seems to be attended with more
difficulties than might be expected. Whoever wishes to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
it fully, and at the same time explain the information of
the ancients, and examine the opinions of the botanists of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (for the modern botanists
give themselves very little trouble in regard to such researches),
must enter into a disquisition of such length as
might be agreeable perhaps to few readers. I shall however
here state what I think I know, and however little it may be,
it will perhaps afford some assistance to those who are desirous
to illustrate the works of the ancient physicians and
agriculturists.</p>

<p>Dioscorides, who, next to Theophrastus among the Greeks,
possessed the greatest share of botanical knowledge, was certainly
acquainted with our carrot, and gave it the name of
<i>staphylinos</i>. For this plant, he says, like dill, bears <i>umbellæ</i>
consisting of white flowers, which in the middle are of a
purple red or almost saffron red colour. Our carrots, it is
well known, have these characteristics, before the <i>umbellæ</i>, towards
the time of their ripening, form themselves into a <i>nidus</i>.
The plant meant by Dioscorides grew wild, but was reared in
gardens, on account of its esculent root; and our carrots are
certainly descended from plants which grew wild, though
Miller, author of the Gardener’s Dictionary, could not succeed
in rendering the small pungent roots eatable by culture.</p>

<p>We must believe Columella and Pliny, that the <i>staphylinos</i>
of the Greeks was, in their time, called <i>pastinaca</i>; though
they give no information from which it can be concluded
that their <i>pastinaca</i> was our carrot. The former speaks of
it as a plant useful to bees, which is the case also with our
wild and cultivated carrots. Afterwards he tells us that it
was cultivated like <i>siser</i>. Those therefore have erred who
consider <i>siser</i> and <i>pastinaca</i> as the same plant, and believe it
to be our liquorice.</p>

<p>That <i>staphylinus</i>, or <i>patinaca</i>, or our carrot, was by the
Greeks called also <i>daucus</i>, is asserted by Pliny, as well as
Galen; and in the Geoponica, <i>daucon</i> is named among the
kitchen vegetables. But Dioscorides seems to make a difference
between <i>staphylinus</i> and <i>daucon</i>, as he treats of them
in different sections. He however says that <i>daucon</i> is like
<i>staphylinus</i>, and has also a white umbella. <i>Daucon</i> perhaps
may have signified a peculiar variety of carrot.</p>

<p>In the last place, that the <i>pastinacæ</i>, or carrots, were named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
also <i>carotæ</i>, is mentioned by Apicius. This word is derived
perhaps from <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κάρτον</span>, which in Athenæus denotes the large
roots of the <i>staphylinus</i>, and also from <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κέρας</span>, which occurs in
Hesychius and Apuleius as a synonym of <i>pastinaca</i>, <i>staphylinus</i>,
and <i>daucion</i>; but it is possible that all these words
may have been corrupted by transcribers. The Germans
and French however have thence formed the appellation <i>carrottes</i>.
But <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κάρος</span>, a plant which <span class="locked">Galen<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a></span> names along with
the roots of the <i>staphylinus</i> and <i>daucus</i>, signified, undoubtedly,
our caraway (<i>Carum Carvi</i>). Dioscorides says that
the spicy aromatic seeds of the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κάρος</span> were used, and that the
roots also were boiled and eaten like carrots. Pliny calls the
plant <i>careum</i>. The Greeks and the Romans therefore were
acquainted with our carrots; but in my opinion they were
far less used in cookery and as fodder for cattle than they are
at present, otherwise they must have more frequently occurred
in the works of the ancients.</p>

<p>But whether, under the term <i>pastinaca</i>, the ancients did
not sometimes understand our parsnip, I will not venture to
determine. I can only assert, with some degree of probability,
that the latter is by Dioscorides called <i>elaphoboscon</i>, a
name which occurs also in Pliny. The former says expressly
that this plant had <i>umbellæ</i> with yellow flowers, and large
white sweet roots fit to be eaten. Now among our umbelliferous
plants, besides dill, fennel and lovage, the parsnip is
the only one which has yellow flowers; at any rate I know
of no other with yellow flowers and esculent roots. If the
parsnip had no other names among the Greeks and the
Romans, it must have been very little used by them; for it
is mentioned only by Dioscorides and Pliny. At present we
know that it forms excellent fodder for black cattle, sheep
and swine.</p>

<p>It needs however excite little wonder that it is so difficult
to discover these plants in the works of the Greeks and the
Romans. They all belong to one natural order, the species
of which can with difficulty be distinguished by the most expert
botanist. I mean to say, that all the umbelliferous
plants are so like to each other, that they may be readily
confounded. This difficulty is still further increased by the
old physicians, who used a great many plants of this kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
and named them after the kitchen vegetables to which they
had a resemblance, so that by these means plants totally different
occur under the same name. To distinguish these, it
is necessary first to examine which of them was a kitchen
vegetable, and which was used in medicine.</p>

<p>Among our kitchen vegetables, as among the spices, there
are many kinds which, at first, were known only on account
of their medicinal properties, but afterwards were esteemed
and cultivated on account of their good taste. Of this kind
is the <span class="locked">scorzonera<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a></span>, which became first known in the middle
of the sixteenth century, in Spain, where it was considered
as an antidote to the poison of a snake called there <i>scurzo</i>.
A Moor, who had learnt this property of it in Africa, cured
with the juice of the leaves and the roots a great many peasants
bitten by snakes while mowing; but he would not discover
the plant, that he might retain all the advantage to
himself. Some persons, however, who followed him to the
mountains, where he collected it, observed that it was the
<i>Scurzonera</i>, or <i>Scorzonera hispanica</i>, so called from the name
of the snake. Petrus Cannizer transmitted the plant, together
with a drawing of it, to John Odorich Melchior, physician
to the queen of Bohemia; and the latter sent what he
had obtained to Matthioli, who at that time was not acquainted
with <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a></span>. Soon after the roots were extolled in a
particular tract by Nicholas Monardes, as a powerful remedy
for the poison of <span class="locked">snakes<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a></span>. It is probable also that these roots
were first used in Spain as food, and about the beginning of
the sixteenth century were carried thence to France. The
anonymous author of the well-known work Le Jardinier
François, who was a gardener, and dealt in trees and seeds
at Paris, boasts of having been the first who introduced these
roots into the French gardens. The first edition of his book,
which greatly contributed to improve gardening in France,
was printed in 1616. At present the roots of the scorzonera
are to be found in most gardens, but no one places faith in
their medicinal virtue; and when they are occasionally prescribed
by any physician for a ptisan perhaps, the other kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
the <i>Scorzonera humilis</i>, is preferred, though in the apothecaries’
shops the Spanish, taken from the gardens, is used in
its <span class="locked">stead<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a></span>.</p>

<p>Among our species of the <i>Allium</i> genus, shallots, in consequence
of their mild taste, are preferred. There can be no
doubt that this name, as well as the French <i>échalotte</i>, is derived
from <i>Ascalonia</i>; and the above species in the system
is called <i>Allium ascalonicum</i><a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a>. Theophrastus, Pliny, Columella,
Apicius, and others, speak of a species called <i>ascalonia</i>,
brought from the city of Ascalon, in Palestine, as we are told
by Pliny, Strabo, and Stephanus. The last-mentioned author
states it as a report, that the first bulbs were observed in that
neighbourhood. These names are found in the oldest catalogues
of the German garden vegetables. There is sufficient
reason also to conjecture that our shallots were the <i>ascaloniæ</i>
of the ancients, and that they came originally from Palestine;
especially as Hasselquist found the same species growing there
wild. An important doubt, however, against this opinion
arises from what is said by Theophrastus and Pliny; namely,
that their <i>ascaloniæ</i> could not be propagated by bulbs, but
by <span class="locked">seeds<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a></span>; on the other hand, our shallots in Germany, and
perhaps in every other part of Europe, never come to flower,
and are obtained only by the bulbs; so that Linnæus procured
the first flowers, through Hasselquist, from Palestine.
But why should not all the other allium species be propagated
by planting the bulbs?</p>

<p>[The kitchen-gardens of England were as scantily supplied
with vegetables, until about the end of the sixteenth century,
as the pleasure-grounds were with shrubs and flowers. “It
was not,” says Hume, “till the end of the reign of Henry VIII.
that any salads, carrots, turnips or other edible roots were
produced in England; the little of these vegetables that was
used was imported from Holland and Flanders. Queen Catherine,
when she wanted a salad, was obliged to despatch a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
messenger thither on purpose.” Hume is not however quite
correct in this point. Our ancestors, before Henry VIIIth’s
time, had always their winter-cresses and water-cresses, and
common Alexanders, which served them for celery; they
had rampion and rocket; borage for their cool tankard, and
amaranthus and goose-foot, or good Henry with sprout-kales,
which they used as greens. Their fruits were neither numerous
nor good, being chiefly confined to gooseberries, currants
and strawberries; the apples and pears were generally
indifferent, and their plums and cherries bad; although the
latter are supposed to have been planted in this country so
early as the year 800, at which time they were brought from
Italy.</p>

<p>The most important of kitchen vegetables of the present
day is certainly the potato. There is scarcely a doubt of
the potato being a native of South America, and its existing
in a wild state in elevated places in the tropical regions and
in the more temperate districts of the western coast of that
country. It appears probable that it was first brought into
Europe from the mountainous parts of South America in the
neighbourhood of Quito, to Spain, early in the sixteenth century;
they were here called <i>papas</i>. From Spain they were
carried to Italy, and there received the same name as the
truffle, <i>taratoufli</i>. From Italy they went to Vienna, through
the governor of Mons in Hainault, who sent some to Clusius
in 1598. The potato arrived in England from North America,
being brought from Virginia by the colonists sent out
by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584, and who returned in July
1586, and in all probability brought back the potato with
them. Such is the opinion of Sir Joseph Banks; moreover,
in De Bry’s Collection of <span class="locked">Voyages<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a></span>, he describes a plant
called <i>openawk</i>, which is in all probability identical with the
potato. Gerarde, in his herbal, published in 1597, figures
the potato, under the name of the potato of Virginia, whence
he says he received the roots. The potato was first cultivated
in Ireland by the grandfather of Sir Robert Southwell,
from tubers given him by Sir W. Raleigh. Some time after,
they were grown in Lancashire, as some say, being conveyed
there through a shipwreck; thence their culture has gradually
diffused itself throughout the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
The great dependence for nourishment placed in the potato
by so many of the poor, has been lately exhibited in the

<h2 id="knitting">KNITTING NETS AND STOCKINGS. STOCKING-LOOM.</h2>

<p>In the art of weaving, the woof is thrown or made to pass
through the numerous threads of the <span class="locked">warp<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a></span>, and is retained
by them; but in knitting there is only one thread, which is
entwined in so ingenious a manner that it produces a tissue
approaching near to cloth, both in its use and appearance,
though it cannot be called cloth, because it is formed without
warp and woof. I will not, however, quarrel in regard to names:
the spider’s web is produced by only one thread, but in a manner
indeed which differs as much from weaving as it does from
knitting; and it is not known with certainty whether Arachne
found out the art of weaving cloth or of making <span class="locked">nets<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a></span>.</p>

<p>There are two methods of knitting, essentially different
from each other; the one employed in making nets, and the
other in knitting stockings. In the former the twine is knotted
into meshes by means of a knitting-needle; whereas in the
knitting of stockings the meshes are produced without knots.
Hence it may be readily comprehended why knit stockings
can be so easily and so speedily un-knit, in order that the
thread may be employed for new work; and why in nets this
is impossible. The knots which prevent it render it on the
other hand possible for nets to be cut or torn asunder, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
destroying more meshes than those immediately exposed
to the force applied. One may easily see also the cause why
things knit in the same manner as stockings can be stretched
without being torn, and, like elastic bodies, again contract as
soon as the action of the distending force ceases. On this
account no kind of cloth has yet been found fitter for gloves,
stockings, garters and bandages. When not too closely knit,
single parts can be extended without injury, as the threads in
the neighbouring meshes give way, and the meshes become
narrow or contracted. This, on account of the knots, is
not possible in knitting of the first kind, which however produces
the best nets, as the meshes suffer the water and mud,
together with the fish that are too small, to pass through them,
and retain only the fish that are larger. A captured fish, in
order to escape, must tear to pieces, after each other, as many
meshes as are equal to the circumference of its body. Were
the net formed in the same manner as a stocking, a single
mesh, if torn, would suffer it to pass <span class="locked">through<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is to be reckoned among the advantages of the present
age, that a readiness in knitting is required as a part of female
education in all ranks; and it may be easily acquired even by
children, with the assistance of an expert and indulgent instructress.
It is however astonishing that this art has not
been banished by the refinement of modern manners, especially
as so much of the time of young females is employed in
the reading of novels and romances. But it is to be observed,
that this occupation, which, with a little practice, becomes so
easy that it may be called rather an amusement, does not interrupt
discourse, distract the attention or check the powers
of the imagination. It forms a ready resource when a vacuity
occurs in conversation, or when a circumstance takes
place which ought to be heard or seen, but not treated with
too much seriousness: the prudent knitter then hears and
sees what she does not wish to seem to hear or to see. Knitting
does no injury either to the body or the mind, the latter
of which suffers from romances. It occasions no prejudicial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
or disagreeable position, requires no straining of the eye-sight,
and can be performed with as much convenience when
standing or walking as when sitting. It may be interrupted
without loss, and again resumed without trouble; and the
whole apparatus for knitting, which is cheap, needs so little
room, and is so light, that it can be kept and gracefully carried
about in a basket, the beauty of which displays the expertness,
or at any rate the taste, of the fair artist. Knitting
belongs to the few useful occupations of old persons, who
have not lost the use of their hands. Those who wish to reproach
the fair sex for the time they waste in endeavouring
to please the men, ought not to forget that the former know
how to occupy those moments which the latter devote, not to
labour, but to social enjoyment or pleasure, or which would
be otherwise lost&mdash;the time in which the male sex are able to
do nothing that is useful. No one, however, will seriously
object this to the male sex, whose daily occupations tend so
much to exhaust the spirits; but is it not to be regretted that
those who, in consequence of their situation, perform properly
no work, who are scarcely under the necessity of thinking,
and who rather become corrupted through idleness, do not
employ their vacant hours in knitting, in order to gain money?
What I mean to say is, should not servants, soldiers, shepherds,
and the male children of the peasants who are unfit for
hard labour, learn to knit, that they might earn something for
themselves and their families? A sale for knit articles,
stockings, mitts, caps, nets and fine lace can never be wanting.
My panegyric, however, on knitting is applicable, strictly
speaking, to the second kind only, which surpasses the first in
utility, but is a much more modern invention; for fishing and
hunting were the oldest occupations, and mention of nets
occurs in the earliest writings.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the people who resided on the
banks of rivers abundant in fish, endeavoured to catch them
at first with baskets, such as those which most of the Indians
know how to make, or with other vessels which suffered the
water to run through them; but that in the course of time a
piece of thin cloth was employed, and at a still later period,
what was far more convenient, nets. Mention however of
fishing and hunting nets occurs very often in the Scriptures;
and in some passages it is clearly proved that we are to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
by them such as were knit. But I shall leave commentators
to determine whether gins composed of ropes or
<span class="locked">cords<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a></span> are not often meant where the translators have introduced
nets. The former are certainly older than the latter;
they were long used both in hunting and in war, and are still
employed among some savage tribes who are not acquainted
with fire-arms.</p>

<p>That nets, however, should be invented at an early period
needs excite no wonder, for they have been found in modern
times among very rude nations. <span class="locked">Wafer<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a></span> saw some among
the American savages which were made of the bark of a tree;
and the Greenlanders made some of the same kind of the hair
of the whale’s beard, and of the sinews of other animals. I
shall omit here what has been said in regard to nets in the
works of the ancients, and particularly in those which treat
on fishing and hunting. The Latins say <i>texere retia</i>; and
Pliny calls the yarn or twine of which nets were made <i>stamen</i>;
yet I am inclined to believe, that both the Greeks and the
Romans made their nets in the same manner as we do at
present.</p>

<p>Weaving, properly so called, is out of the question; and
it appears that these words were used in a very general sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
because there was then no term of art to denote knitting.
At any rate, I cannot believe that the far more ingenious
process by which our lace-weavers prepare the netted scarfs
used by military officers was then known, as Braun seems to
<span class="locked">think<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a></span>. Meshes were called by the Latins <i>maculæ</i> and <i>nodi</i>;
but I as little understand what Pliny says, “retia succino nodantur,”
as the supposed explanation of Hardouin, “retia
nodos e succino <span class="locked">habebant<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a></span>.” The author alludes here perhaps
to some ornament added to those nets which were drawn
round the boxes or seats of the senators. Some manuscripts
read <i>notantur</i>: I should have preferred <i>ornantur</i>.</p>

<p>The art of making nets of fine yarn, silk, or cotton, by the
process of knitting, and employing them as articles of dress
or ornament, is not an invention of modern luxury. I remember
to have seen in old churches retiform hangings, and
on old dresses of ceremony borders or trimming of the same
kind, which fashion seems alternately to have banished and
recalled. That in the middle ages the mantles of the clergy
had often coverings of silk made in the same manner as
fishing-nets, has been proved by Du <span class="locked">Cange<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a></span>. I suspect also
that the transparent dresses used by the ladies, more than
four hundred years ago, to cover those beauties which they
still wished to be visible, were nets of this <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a></span>.</p>

<p>Far more ingenious and of much later invention is that art
which was undoubtedly first employed in making stockings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
and on that account called stocking-knitting. That the Romans
and most of the ancient nations had no particular
clothing for the lower part of the body, is so well known,
that it is unnecessary for me to repeat the proofs. Their
legs however did not suffer more from the cold than our
hands when they are not covered by gloves, or than the feet
of the Franciscans at present; and what is common is not
indecent. It is well known that the northern nations first
had hose or trowsers, which covered not only the legs but
the thighs and loins; and it was not till a few centuries ago,
that from this article of dress people began to make two; the
upper part retained the old name, and the lower, that which
covered the legs, was called in German <i>strumpf</i>, <i>truncus</i>,
which word Maler in his Dictionary explains by <i>halbhosen</i>,
half-hose, and <i>hosenstrumpf</i>. The diminutive <i>strümpfle</i> signifies,
according to this author, hose that reach to the calf of
the leg. The first stockings were of cloth, and made by the
tailors; consequently they were not so commodious as our
knit-stockings, which, for the reason already mentioned, become
closely contracted, without pressing the foot or impeding
a person in walking.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that the art of knitting stockings
was first found out in the sixteenth century, but the time of
the invention is doubtful; it is also uncertain to what people
we are indebted for it, and the name of the inventor is entirely
unknown. Savary appears to be the first person who
hazarded the <span class="locked">conjecture<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a></span>, that this art is a Scottish invention,
because the French stocking-knitters, when they became so
numerous as to form a guild, made choice of St. Fiacre, a
native of Scotland, to be their patron; and besides this, there
is a tradition, that the first knit stockings were brought to
France from that country. However this may be, it is certain
that the first letter of foundation for this guild, named
“la Communauté des Maitres Bonnetiers au Tricot,” is
dated the 16th, or, as others say, the 26th of August 1527.
St. Fiacre, I shall here remark, was the second son of Eugenius,
who is said to have been king of Scotland in the beginning
of the seventh century; he lived as a hermit at Meaux
in France, and his name in the sacred calendar stands opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
to the 30th of <span class="locked">August<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a></span>. It must however be acknowledged
that Savary’s conjecture rests only on a very slight
foundation.</p>

<p>Somewhat more probable is an opinion, which has been
long prevalent in England, and is supported by the testimony
of respectable writers. Howell, in his History of the World,
printed in 1680, relates that Henry VIII., who reigned from
1509 to 1547, and who was fond of show and magnificence,
wore at first woollen stockings; till by a singular occurrence
he received a pair of knit silk stockings from Spain. His son
Edward VI., who succeeded him on the throne, obtained by
means of a merchant named Thomas Gresham, a pair of long
Spanish knit silk stockings; and this present was at that time
highly prized. Queen Elizabeth, in the third year of her
reign, that is in 1561, received by her silk-woman, named
Montague, a pair of black silk knit stockings, and afterwards
would not wear any other <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a></span>.</p>

<p>This information is confirmed by another account. It is
related in Stow’s Chronicle, that the earl of Pembroke was
the first nobleman who wore worsted knit stockings. In the
year 1564, William Rider, an apprentice of Master Thomas
Burdet, having accidentally seen in the shop of an Italian
merchant a pair of knit worsted stockings, procured from
Mantua, and having borrowed them, made a pair exactly like
them, and these were the first stockings knit in England of
woollen yarn.</p>

<p>From this testimony, it has been hitherto believed in
England that knit stockings were first made known there
under Henry VIII.; that they were brought from Spain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
that country; and that the invention belongs, in all probability,
to the Spaniards. Were this really the case, one might
conjecture that the first knit stockings known in England
were of silk, though the imitations made by Rider were of
wool. For under Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth,
silk stockings only are mentioned; and at that period silk,
and not woollen articles, were imported from Italy and Spain.
Did the invention belong to the Spaniards, I should be inclined
to conjecture that these people obtained it from the
Arabians, to whom we are indebted for many useful and ingenious
arts. But at any rate the conjecture of Savary falls
to the ground; for as the French had a stocking-knitters’
guild as early as 1527, it is highly improbable that the
English, forty years after, or about the year 1564, should
have been unacquainted with the invention of their nearest
neighbours, the Scots.</p>

<p>Some years ago, however, several learned men in England
were led, by a singular circumstance, to collect information
in regard to the antiquity of the art of knitting stockings.
I here allude to the forgeries of Thomas Chatterton, who was
born on the 20th of November 1752, and terminated his unfortunate
life by suicide on the 24th of August 1770. This
ingenious youth published some poems which he pretended
were written by Thomas Rowley, who lived in the reign of
Edward IV., that is about the year 1461. Many literary
men denied the authenticity of these poems, though they
possessed great beauty; proclaimed Chatterton to be a second
Psalmanasar; and justified their opinion by the circumstance
of knit stockings being mentioned in them. This they
said was an anachronism, as the invention of knitting stockings,
according to Howell and Stow, must be a century
later than the supposed poet Rowley. Others, who supported
the genuineness of these poems, endeavoured on that
account to make the invention older, and collected information
in regard to the history of it, from which I have made
the following <span class="locked">extract<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the sixteenth century the people of
Scotland had breeches, in the proper sense of the word, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
wore a kind of stockings; for Hector Boethius, who was
professor at Aberdeen in 1497, relates that the Scots wore
hose which reached only to the knee, consequently stockings
made of linen or woollen, and breeches chiefly of <span class="locked">hemp<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a></span>.</p>

<p>These particular articles of dress were usual at that time
even in England; for in the year 1510 king Henry VIII. appeared,
on a public occasion, with his attendants, in elegant
dresses, in the description of which breeches and hose are
particularly <span class="locked">mentioned<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1530, the word <i>knit</i>, applied to stockings, must
have been common in England; for at that time John Palsgrave,
French master to the Princess Mary, daughter of
Henry VIII., published a grammar, in which he stated that
this word in French was applied to the making of nets as well
as of caps and stockings.</p>

<p>From a household book of a noble family in the time of
Henry VIII., we learn that knit stockings, both for grown-up
people and children, were sold at so low a price that it cannot
be supposed they were foreign <span class="locked">articles<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward VI. various kinds of knit articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
must have been made in England, as appears by some regulations
relating to trade and manufactures issued in <span class="locked">1552<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a></span>.</p>

<p>It nevertheless can be proved, that in the fifth year of the
reign of queen Mary, that is in 1558, there were many who
wore stockings of cloth; for Dr. Sands, who was afterwards
archbishop of York, sent for a tailor to measure him for a
pair of <span class="locked">hose<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a></span>. This might serve to confirm the assertion of
Stow, that stockings were not knit in England till six years
after. But according to the testimonies already produced,
this cannot be true. It is much more credible, that the
clergy and old people, who are not ready to adopt new modes,
wore some years later the old-fashioned stockings of cloth,
which in all probability were similar to our gaiters.</p>

<p>It might be mentioned, as a further proof, if necessary, of
breeches and stockings being considered, long before the
reign of queen Elizabeth, as separate parts of dress, that in
the catalogue then drawn up of the revenue of the bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
St. Asaph, it is stated that he received as a perquisite, on the
death of every clergyman who had a living, his best breeches
and <span class="locked">stockings<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a></span>.</p>

<p>About 1577, that is ten years after the period of the invention
as given by Stow, knitting must have been common
throughout all England, and practised even in villages. The
bark of the alder was used by the wives of the peasants for
dyeing the stockings which they had <span class="locked">knitted<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a></span>.</p>

<p>According to the well-known poet George <span class="locked">Gascoigne<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a></span>,
the greatest ornaments in dress, about the year 1576, were
knit silk stockings and Spanish leather shoes.</p>

<p>About 1579, and not 1570 as stated in the Gentleman’s
Magazine, when queen Elizabeth was at Norwich, several
female children appeared before her, some of whom were
spinning worsted yarn, and others knitting worsted yarn <span class="locked">hose<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a></span>.</p>

<p>The art of knitting stockings would be much older in Germany
than in France or in England; and Chatterton, at any
rate, would be freed from the charge of committing an anachronism,
were it true, as Micrælius wrote in the year 1639,
that the consort of the duke of Pomerania, who died in 1417,
when she could no longer sew or embroider amused herself
with <span class="locked">knitting<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a></span>. But it is very probable that this good man
committed an anachronism, like Chatterton; and, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
show the industry of the duchess, named those occupations
which were usual in his own time.</p>

<p>In Germany, as far as I know at present, stocking-knitters
occur for the first time about the middle of the sixteenth
century, under the name of <i>hosenstricker</i>, a term which in
Lower Saxony is still not uncommon. At Hamburg the
people say <i>hasenknütter</i>, and use the word <i>hase</i> for stockings.
In Berlin there were stocking-knitters about the year 1590.
In many countries they had a particular guild; and this is
the case at present in the duchy of Wirtemberg, where they
are entirely different from those who work at the loom, and
who are called <i>stocking-weavers</i>. Each have their own regulations,
in which it is ordered that the stocking-knitters shall
wear no articles wove, that is knit, in a loom, and the stocking-weavers
no articles knit with the hand. That knitting however
may be left free, as an occasional occupation to every
one, the following words are inserted in the regulations of
the stocking-knitters:&mdash;“Poor people, who through want of
other means procure a subsistence by knitting stockings, and
those who at the gates keep watch for themselves or others,
and at the same time knit, shall be at liberty to wear whatever
they make with their own hands.”</p>

<p>The German terms of art which relate to knitting are older
than the art itself, for they are all borrowed from the making
of nets; <i>knütten</i>, <i>knüteisen</i>, <i>knütholz</i>, <i>knütspan</i>, <i>stricken</i> and
<i>stricknadel</i>, and also <i>maschen</i>, are all terms which occur in
the fishing-regulations of Brandenburg for the year 1574,
and no doubt earlier. The <i>tricoter</i> of the French had the
same origin as the German word <i>stricken</i>: <i>Trica</i> was a lock
of hair, a noose; and <i>tricare</i> signified to entangle, and deceive.
<i>Lacer</i> is derived from <i>laqs</i>, a rope, a noose; and this
comes from <i>laqueus</i>. The English word <i>stocking</i> is derived
from <i>stock</i>, <i>truncus</i>, the trunk of a tree, a word still retained
by the German foresters, who in the Low German speak of
rooting out <i>stocks</i>.</p>

<p>Silk stockings, however, in consequence of their high price,
were for a long time used only on very grand occasions.
Henry II., king of France, wore such stockings for the first
time at the marriage of his sister with the duke of Savoy in
<span class="locked">1559<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a></span>. In the reign of Henry III., who ascended the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
in 1575, the consort of Geoffroy Camus de Pontcarre, who
held a high office in the state, would not wear silk stockings
given to her by a nurse, who lived at court, as a Christmas
present, because she considered them to be too gay. In the
year 1569, when the privy-counsellor Barthold von Mandelsloh,
who had been envoy to many diets and courts, appeared
on a week-day at court with silk stockings which he had
brought from Italy, the margrave John of Custrin said to
him, “Barthold, I have silk stockings also; but I wear them
only on Sundays and holidays.” The celebrated Leonard
Thurneisser, however, who lived at the court of Brandenburg
about the end of the sixteenth century, wore silk
stockings daily, and in general dressed very magnificently in
silk and velvet.</p>

<p>Knitting with wires, the method of which I have hitherto
spoken, has always appeared to me so ingenious, that I conceived
the inventor of it must have had a pattern to serve as
a guide. This pattern I think I have discovered. Wire-workers,
and other artists who used wire, exercised their ingenuity
some centuries ago, more than at present, in making
wire-screens in various ways; and it must be confessed that
many of them produced articles, which even at present,
though not suited to the modern taste, deserve admiration.
Works of this kind may still be found in old churches. The
art of making them has often been considered as too difficult
for human hands; and hence popular tradition has asserted
that the artists were assisted by the devil. A tale of this
kind is still related, though no longer believed, to those whose
curiosity induces them to view the wire-screen which surrounds
the baptismal font in St. Mary’s church at Wismar,
and which is plaited or wove in so ingenious a manner, as if
with ropes, that neither the beginning nor end of the wires
can be observed. A similar legend is told to strangers when
shown the screen around the pulpit in the cathedral of Lubec,
which, according to the inscription, was made in 1572. It
is not improbable that, among works of this kind, some may
be found made with meshes, as if formed by knitting. Our
pin-makers can construct some much more ingenious. That
I might be better able in my technological lectures to convey
to my pupils an idea of knitting, I made a drawing on the
subject, and caused a pin-maker to weave for me a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
screen of brass wire. This work is easy, because it is executed
in a frame of strong but pliable wire. I suspect therefore
that some one first tried to make an imitation of such a
wire-net with yarn, and in one expanded piece, for which
only two or three small sticks would be necessary. Instead
of having a frame, the inventor, it is probable, fastened to
his clothes the stick on which the meshes were made, or on
which he knitted; but afterwards employed a sheath to perform
that service. Thus, most of the Wirtemberg stocking-knitters,
at present, knit with two wires and a sheath. Hence
their stockings, like those wove in the stocking-loom, are
sewed or have a seam behind.</p>

<p>Among the master-pieces of the Wirtemberg stocking-knitters,
a carpet of beautiful flower-work and figures is mentioned
in their regulations. It is milled, and when spread
out measures three ells in length and one and a half in breadth.
It is probable that some person, by repeated trials, found out
the method of knitting in a circular form; but for this purpose
several wires would be necessary. In order to render
this improved art of knitting similar to the old method, the
meshes were so arranged that the stockings seemed to have a
seam, for which however there was no occasion. The sheath,
which was fastened to the left side, was long retained by our
knitters; but as it retarded the work, and as it was necessary
to keep the body in an uneasy posture, injurious to the growth
of young and industrious persons, means were devised to
dispense with it and to knit with much less restraint. In this
manner the art was brought to its present perfection; and it
must excite no small astonishment when it is considered that
it was invented all at once, and by one person.</p>

<p>The invention of the stocking-loom is worthy of more admiration,
when one reflects that it was not a matter of accident,
like most of the great discoveries, but the result of
talents and genius. It is a machine exceedingly complex,
consisting of two thousand parts, which, in a moment almost,
can make two hundred meshes of loops, without requiring
much skill or labour in the workman. There are few descriptions
of this machine; and those published do not fully answer
the <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a></span>. But my object is merely the question, Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
was the inventor, in what country, and at what time did he
live? and I can say, that after the most diligent research, it
does not appear subject to any doubt, as some have hitherto
believed.</p>

<p>Under the administration of Cromwell, the stocking-knitters
of London presented a petition, in which they requested permission
to establish a guild. In this petition they gave to the
Protector an account of the rise, progress, and importance of
their art or trade; and there can be no doubt that this well-written
document contains the oldest authentic information
in regard to this invention, which was then scarcely fifty years
old. Every thing must then have been fresh in the memory
of those by whom it was drawn up; every circumstance could
easily be examined; and the petitioners must have been sensible
that their misrepresentations, for which however they
had no reason, could easily be contradicted. However unimportant
my research may appear, it gave me much pleasure
to find a copy of this petition in Deering’s Account of Nottingham,
already mentioned, in which the author has collected
many authentic circumstances from the records of that town,
where the loom was first employed and enriched many families,
and whence the use of it was spread all over England and
<span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a></span>.</p>

<p>From these it appears that the real inventor was William
Lee, whose name in the petition is written Lea, a native of
Woodborough, in Nottinghamshire, a village about seven
miles distant from the town of Nottingham. He was heir to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
a considerable freehold estate, and a graduate of St. John’s
College, Cambridge. It is reported, that being enamoured of
a young country-girl, who during his visits paid more attention
to her work, which was knitting, than to her lover and
his proposals, he endeavoured to find out a machine which
might facilitate and forward the operation of knitting, and by
these means afford more leisure to the object of his affection
to converse with him. Love indeed is fertile in inventions,
and gave rise, it is said, to the art of painting; but a machine
so complex in its parts and so wonderful in its effects, would
seem to require longer and quieter reflection, more judgement,
and more time and patience, than can be expected in a lover.
But even if the cause should appear problematical, there can
be no doubt in regard to the inventor, whom most of the
English writers positively assert to have been William Lee.</p>

<p>Aaron Hill seems to make the stocking-loom younger, and
relates the circumstance in the following manner. A student
of Oxford was so imprudent as to marry at an early period,
without money and without income. His young wife, however,
was able to procure the necessaries of life by knitting;
but as the natural consequences of love, an increase of family,
was likely to render this soon insufficient, the husband invented
a machine by which knitting could be performed in a
speedier and more profitable manner. Having thus completed
a stocking-loom, he became by its means a man of
considerable <span class="locked">wealth<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a></span>. But Hill, in his account, gives neither
names, date, nor proofs; and as he seems to have formed it
from an imperfect remembrance of what he had heard or
read in regard to Lee, it is not worthy of further examination.</p>

<p>Deering says expressly, that Lee made the first loom in
the year 1589; and this account has been adopted by Anderson
and most of the English writers. In the stocking-weavers’
hall, at London, is an old painting, in which Lee is represented
pointing out his loom to a female knitter, who is standing
near him; and below it is seen an inscription with the date
1589, which was the year of the <span class="locked">invention<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a></span>. Other accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
make it somewhat later. Thus Howell, after relating that
Queen Elizabeth obtained the first stockings in 1561, says
that thirty-nine years after the loom was invented by Lee, in
which case the period would be <span class="locked">1600<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a></span>. In the petition of
the stocking-knitters it is stated, that the loom, at that time,
had been found out about fifty years. It is to be regretted
that this document has no date; but as Cromwell reigned
from 1653 to 1658, the invention would fall in the beginning
of the seventeenth century. It is more probable, however,
that it belongs to the end of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>Lee instructed his brother James in the use of the loom,
and took apprentices and assistants, with whom he carried on
business for some years at Calverton, a village five miles
distant from Nottingham. On this account, Calverton has by
some been considered as his birth-place. He showed his
work to Queen Elizabeth, who died in 1603, and requested
from that princess some support or remuneration; but he
obtained neither, and was impeded rather than assisted in his
undertaking. Under these circumstances, Lee accepted an
invitation from Henry IV. king of France, who had heard of
this invention, and promised to give a handsome reward to
the author of it. He therefore carried nine journeymen and
several looms to Rouen in Normandy, where he worked with
great approbation; but the king being assassinated, and internal
commotions having taken place, Lee fell into great
distress, and died soon after at Paris. Two only of his people
remained in France, one of whom was still alive when the
before-mentioned petition was presented to Cromwell. Seven
of them returned to England; and these, with a person named
Aston, who at first was a miller at Thoroton, the place of his
<span class="locked">birth<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a></span>, but afterwards an apprentice of Lee, by whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
had been left behind in England, where he made some improvements
in the loom, laid the foundation of the stocking-manufactory
in that country. The number of masters increased
there in the course of fifty years so much, that it was
found necessary to unite them into one guild; for which
Cromwell, however, in consequence of reasons not known,
refused the proper sanction; but in 1663 they received letters
patent, which gave them certain privileges to the extent of
ten miles round London.</p>

<p>In the year 1614, the Venetian ambassador, Antonio Correr,
persuaded an apprentice, Henry Mead, by the promise of five
hundred pounds sterling, to go with a loom to Venice for a
stated time, and to teach there the use of it. Mead met with
a favourable reception in that city, and was much admired;
but the loom becoming deranged, and no person at Venice
being able to repair it, when the time of his agreement was
expired, he returned to England. The Venetians had not
resolution enough to continue the attempt; and sent the damaged
loom, together with some bad imitations of it, to London,
where they were sold for a mere trifle. Such is the
account given in the petition before-mentioned.</p>

<p>Zano, however, an Italian <span class="locked">writer<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a></span>, asserts, on the authority
of information preserved in manuscript among family documents,
that Correr carried two stocking-weavers with looms
to Venice; that he immediately placed under them four apprentices,
and when they went back to England sent with
them a boy, who returned to Venice well-instructed in the art,
and who continued to carry on business there with great
success. Giambattista Carli of Gemona, a smith who worked
in steel, saw the loom at Venice, which had been made after
the model of those brought from England and sold to Francesco
Alpruni of Udina. In a short time a great many stockings
were manufactured there, and sent for sale, chiefly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Gradisca in Austria. But, in consequence of the poverty of
the Venetian stocking-knitters, an order was issued that Carli
should make no more looms; and this productive branch of
business at Udina was so much deranged, that the masters
removed with their looms to Gradisca, where the inhabitants
of Udina were obliged to purchase such stockings as they had
occasion to use.</p>

<p>Some years after the stocking-loom had been introduced
at Venice, Abraham Jones, who understood stocking-weaving
and the construction of the loom, though never regularly
taught, went with some assistants to Amsterdam, where he
worked on his own account two or three years, till he and
his people were carried off by a contagious disease. The
looms, because no one could use them, were sent to London
and sold for a low price. In the petition to Cromwell the
masters state, with great satisfaction, that in this manner the
trade had remained in England; and, that it may be exclusively
retained in their native country, they wish for the
establishment of a privileged company.</p>

<p>It appears to me therefore proved beyond all doubt, that
the stocking-loom was invented by William Lee, an Englishman,
about the end of the sixteenth century; and this is admitted
by some French writers, such as <span class="locked">Voltaire<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a></span> and the
editor of the first Encyclopédie, whom the author of the Encyclopédie
Méthodique however finds fault with. Other
French writers, who are the more numerous party, wish to
ascribe the honour of this invention to one of their own
countrymen; but the proofs they bring are so weak that they
scarcely deserve notice. Savary perhaps is the first person
who publicly ventured to support this instance of Gallic
vanity; at any rate he is quoted by the more modern writers
as their authority when they wish to contradict the English.</p>

<p>According to his account, a Frenchman, of whom however
he knows nothing further, invented the stocking-loom; but
not being able to obtain the exclusive privilege of using it in
his own country, went with it to England. The utility of it
being soon discovered there, it was forbidden, under pain of
death, to carry a loom or a model of it out of the kingdom.
But another Frenchman, respecting whom he is equally ignorant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
having seen the loom, the form of it made so deep an
impression on his memory, that on his return he copied it
exactly; and from this loom all the others used in France
and Holland were constructed. Savary adds, did the invention
belong to the English, who are accustomed to pay due honour to
those who discover useful things, they undoubtedly could tell
the name of the inventor, which however they are not able
to do. It is very strange that this should be written by a
Frenchman, who himself did not know the name of the French
inventor, or of the person who carried back the invention.
No order to prevent the exportation of the stocking-loom was
issued in England so early, else it would certainly have been
mentioned in the petition presented to Cromwell. It was not
till the eighth year of the reign of William III., that is 1696,
when looms were everywhere common, that the exportation
of them was forbidden; probably because the best were
made in England, and it was wished that the gradual improvement
of them should be kept secret. The penalty also was
not death, but a fine and confiscation of the looms.</p>

<p>Some have endeavoured to give an air of probability to
this assertion of Savary, by the relation of an apothecary in
the Hotel-Dieu at Paris. This person is said to have declared
that the inventor was a journeyman locksmith of Lower
Normandy, who gave a pair of silk stockings, his own workmanship,
to Colbert, in order that they might be presented to
Louis XIV.; but as the <i>marchands bonetiers</i>, who dealt in
articles knit according to the old manner, caused several
loops of these stockings to be cut by some of the servants at
court, whom they had bribed for that purpose, they did not
meet with approbation. The inventor was so hurt by this
disappointment, that he sold the loom to an Englishman, and
died an old man in the Hotel-Dieu, where the apothecary
became acquainted with him. It was necessary to expose the
lives of many workmen, and even of some men of learning,
in order to bring back a loom to France. Romè de la Platière
adds, that he heard at Nimes, that in the time of Colbert
a person of that place, named Cavellier, carried the first loom
to France; and that, in the course of fifty years, the number
of the looms in that town and neighbourhood increased to
some thousands. It appears much more certain that the
stocking manufactory, as Savary asserts, was established at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
the castle of Madrid in the Bois Boulogne near Paris, in the
year 1656, under the direction of John Hindret.</p>

<p>I do not know at what time the first loom was brought to
Germany; but it is certain that this branch of manufacture
was spread chiefly by the French refugees who sought shelter
in that country after the revocation of the edict of Nantes.
Winkelmann says expressly, that they carried the first looms
to Hesse. This is not at all improbable, because our stocking
manufacturers give French names to every part of their
looms, as well as to their different kinds of work. Becher
boasts of having introduced the loom at Vienna, and of having
first constructed looms of wood. At present many wooden
ones are made at Obernhau in the Erzgebürge, and sold at
the rate of twenty-eight dollars; whereas iron ones, of the
most inferior kind, are sold in Vogtland for sixty or seventy.</p>

<p>[In 1663 a charter was granted by Charles II. to the
Frame-work Knitters’ Society of London (stocking-makers),
which had been refused to them a few years before by Oliver
Cromwell. Six years afterwards the number of stocking-frames
in England amounted to 700, employing 1200 workmen,
three-fifths of whom made silk stockings, and the others
worsted; for cotton was not then ranked among English
manufactures. By 1714 the number of frames had increased
to 8000 or 9000. Some years after this, the Frame-work
Knitters’ Company attempted to control both the manufacture
itself, and the making and selling of the stockings; but the
project failed. By the year 1753 the number of frames in
England was 14,000. In 1758 a machine for making ribbed
stockings was patented by Mr. Strutt of Belper.</p>

<p>In 1838 stocking-frames with a rotatory action, and worked
by steam, were successfully brought into use in Nottingham.
Of the present extent and value of the hosiery manufacture,
perhaps the best estimate is that made a few years ago by
Mr. Felkin of Nottingham. This gentleman calculates the
value of cotton hosiery annually made at £880,000, that of
worsted at £870,000, and that of silk at £241,000. He estimates
the number of stockings annually manufactured at
3,510,000 dozens; and in the production of these there are
used 4,584,000 lbs. of raw cotton, value £153,000; 140,000
lbs. of raw silk, value £91,000; and 6,318,000 lbs. of English
wool, value £316,000; making the total value of the materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
£560,000, which are ultimately converted into the exchangeable
value of £1,991,000. The total number of persons
employed is 73,000.]</p>

mistakes respecting these noose-ropes, because they were not acquainted
with the nature of them. Their use among the Parthians is confirmed by
Suidas, under the word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σειραὶ</span>, p. 303; where he says that on that account
they were called <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">σειροφόροι</span>. Josephus asserts that they were employed
by the Alani, and relates that Tiridates would have been caught in this
manner, had he not quickly cut to pieces the rope. Under the same head
may be comprehended the <i>retiarii</i> and <i>laquearii</i>, in the bloody spectacles
of the Romans, whose method of fighting is said to have been found out
by Pittacus. See Diogen. Laert. i. 74. To this subject belong the snares
of the devil, pestilence, and death, in the Scriptures, and particularly in
Psalm xviii. ver. 5. The <i>laquei mortis</i> of Horace, Carm. iii. 24, 8, were
hence to be explained, and not by a Hebraism, as some of the old commentators
have imagined. In the ordeals of the ancient Germans, when
a man was obliged to combat with a woman, the latter had a rope with a
noose, which she threw over her antagonist, who stood in a pit, in order
that she might more easily overcome him. That such ropes are still employed
among various nations is proved by Vancouver. In Hungary the
wild horses at present are said to be caught by ropes of this kind.</p></div>

wore new <i>weite hauptfinstern</i>, so that the men almost saw their breasts;”
and Moser, who quotes this passage in his Phantasien, conjectures that
the <i>hauptfinstern</i> might approach near to lace. I never met with the
word anywhere else; but Frisch, in his Dictionary, says, “<i>Vinster</i> in a
Vocabularium of the year 1492 is explained by the words <i>drat</i>, <i>schudrat</i>,
thread, coarse thread.” May it not be the word <i>fenster</i>, a window? And
in that case may it not allude to the wide meshes? <i>Fenestratum</i> meant
formerly, perforated or reticulated; and this signification seems applicable
to those shoes mentioned by Du Cange under the name of <i>calcei fenestrati</i>.
At any rate it is certain that the article denoted by <i>hauptfinstern</i>
belonged to those dresses mentioned by Seneca in his treatise De Beneficiis,
59. Pliny says that such dresses were worn, “ut in publico matrona

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="hops">HOPS.</h2>

<p>My object, in this article, is not to give a history of beer,
because for that purpose it would be necessary to define accurately
the different kinds of grain mentioned in the writings
of the Greeks and the Romans; and this would be a tedious,
as well as difficult, and to me a very unpleasant labour; as I
should be obliged to controvert a great many received opinions.
I shall only endeavour to answer the question, Where
and at what time did hops begin to be used as an addition to
beer? This subject has already engaged the attention of
two learned <span class="locked">men<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a></span>, whose researches I shall employ and enlarge
by my own observations.</p>

<p>Hops at present are so well known, that a formal description
of them would be superfluous. I think it necessary, however,
for the sake of perspicuity, to state what follows. This
plant at present grows wild in the greater part of Europe,
and in Germany is common in the hedges and fences. It
clings to the trunks of trees, and often climbs round poles, if
long enough, to the height of twenty or thirty feet. It is
almost everywhere rough and sharp to the touch, and sometimes
clammy. The leaves are generally divided into three,
and often into five indented lobes; but the upper ones are
shaped like a heart and undivided. The male plants bear
flowers, like those of the currant-bush or of the male hemp;
the female plants produce their flowers in cones, which are
not unlike those of the fir, except that the latter are woody,
while the former are foliaceous. These cones only are used
for beer; on that account the female plants alone are cultivated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
and from these they are picked and dried as soon as
they begin to become pulverulent. They are transplanted or
propagated by means of seedlings, in hop-grounds properly
prepared, where the cones become larger and better than
those of the wild plants, which however are not entirely useless.
They are added to beer to render it more palatable, by
giving it an agreeable bitter taste; and, at the same time, to
make it keep longer; and it must indeed be confessed, that
of the numerous and various additions which since the earliest
periods have been tried, none has better answered the purpose,
or been more generally employed.</p>

<p>Among the botanists of the last two centuries, who perused
the writings of the Greeks and the Romans, and endeavoured
to discover those plants which they meant to describe, many
imagined that they found in them hops. But when one takes
the trouble to examine without prejudice their opinions, nothing
appears but a very slight probability; and some even
of these learned botanists, such as Matthioli and others, have
acknowledged that it cannot be proved that the Greeks and
the Romans were acquainted with our hops.</p>

<p>The plant which perhaps has been chiefly considered as
the hop is the <i>Smilax aspera</i><a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> of <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a></span>, the same no
doubt as that described by Theophrastus under the name of
<i>smilax</i>, without any <span class="locked">epithet<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a></span>. That the description agrees for
the most part with our hops cannot be denied; but it is
equally true that it might be applied, with no less propriety,
to many other creeping plants, and certainly with the greatest
probability to that which in the Linnæan system has retained
the name <i>Smilax aspera</i>. What the Grecian writer says of
the fruit is particularly applicable to this plant; but, on the
other hand, it differs from the fruit of the hop.</p>

<p>One might with more probability conjecture that hops occur
in <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a></span>, under the name <i>Lupus salictarius</i>. But the
whole of what he says of this plant is, that it was esculent,
and grew in the willow plantations. This is undoubtedly true
of hops, for that the young shoots are eaten in spring as salad
is well known; but the name <i>lupus</i> alone has induced the
commentator to apply all this, though equally applicable to
other plants, to our hop, which at present is called <i>lupulus</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Much more unfounded is the conjecture, that the hop is that
wild plant which, according to the account of Cato, was used
as fodder for <span class="locked">cattle<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a></span>. But the word in manuscripts is differently
written, and consequently uncertain; besides, there are
many plants which might be employed in the place of straw.</p>

<p>It is certainly possible that hops might have been in use
among the northern nations, at the time of these writers,
without their having any knowledge of them; for the
Romans were acquainted with beer only from the accounts
given of the Germans and their <span class="locked">manners<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a></span>, and they considered
that beverage merely as an unsuccessful imitation of
their wine. But I agree in opinion with Conring, Meibomius,
and others, that hops were not used till a much later
period. The names <i>humulus</i> and <i>lupulus</i> also are of no great
antiquity. The former is the oldest, and seems to belong to
the people who first added this improvement to beer. The
<i>humble</i> and <i>humle</i> of the Swedes and Danes, the <i>chumel</i> of
the Bohemians, the <i>houblon</i> of the French and the Spanish,
Hungarian and Persian appellations, all seem to be derived
from the same origin, as well as the Latin names of later times,
<i>humelo</i>, <i>humolo</i>, <i>humulo</i>, <i>humlo</i><a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a>. <i>Lupulus</i> does not occur
till a much later period. The German word, which the English
also have adopted, appears first to have been written
<i>hoppe</i>, from which was formed afterwards in High German
<i>Hopfen</i>, by converting, as it commonly does, the double <i>p</i>
into the harder <i>pf</i>. Thus from <i>toppe</i> it has made <i>topf</i>, and
from <i>koppe</i>, <i>kopf</i>, &amp;c. As far as I know, this word is found,
for the first time, in a dictionary which seems to be of the
tenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a></span>, and which has <i>Timalus</i>, <i>Hoppe</i> and <i>Brandigabo
Feldhoppe</i>. According to my conjecture, <i>timalus</i> has
been erroneously printed for <i>humulus</i>; but in regard to <i>brandigabo</i>
I can give no explanation. It is derived perhaps from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
<i>brace</i> or <i>bracium</i>. The former was known to <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a></span>; and
the latter occurs in the same dictionary along with the translation,
malt.</p>

<p>No mention is made of hops either in Walafrid Strabo, who
died in 849, or in Æmilius Macer, who cannot have lived
earlier than the year 850; in the laws of the old Franks, in
which beer and malt are often mentioned, or in the Capitulare
de Villis Imperatoris, which are ascribed to Charles
the Great. Had beer been then used and brewed in Germany,
it would certainly have been at any rate mentioned by
the emperor. Haller <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a></span> it is related by Isidorus that the
experiment of adding hops to beer was first made in Italy.
Were this the case, it would be the oldest mention of that
circumstance, for Isidorus died in the year 636. It is however
not only highly improbable that the use of hops should
be discovered in Italy, which is a wine country, but it can be
proved to be false. Not the smallest notice of it is to be
found in the whole work of Isidorus; and in the Bibliotheca
Botanica, when Haller had the book before him and extracted
from it many things remarkable, he does not repeat this <span class="locked">assertion<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a></span>.
The passage which has given rise perhaps to this
error, appears to be that where the author describes a kind of
beer called by him <i>celia</i>, and where the germination of corn,
the shooting of malt, and the sweet wort made from it, together
with its fermentation, are clearly mentioned, but not
<span class="locked">hops<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a></span>. Some one perhaps thought that hops also ought to
be supposed in this passage, else beer would not acquire that
strong taste and intoxicating quality spoken of by Isidorus,
who very properly ascribes both to fermentation. The same
account has been repeated by <span class="locked">Vincentius<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a></span>, without any change
or addition. But as Isidorus scarcely contains anything which
is not borrowed from earlier writers, I endeavoured to discover
the source of that information, and at length found it
in the history of <span class="locked">Orosius<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a></span>, who, as is well known, lived in the
fifth century.</p>

<p>In the Latin translation of the works of the Arabian physician
<span class="locked">Mesue<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a></span> is a description, but as is commonly the case, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
defective one, of a creeping plant, with rough indented leaves
under the name of <i>lupulus</i>, which indeed corresponds exceedingly
well with our hops. The cones in particular are exactly
described. The author, however, speaks there only of the
medicinal qualities of the plant, and makes no mention of its
application to beer. Mesue lived about the year 845, consequently
is the first who uses the term <i>lupuli</i>. But we have
only a wretched old translation of the writings of this physician;
it is probable that the word <i>lupulus</i> comes only
from the translator. This passage therefore can prove nothing.</p>

<p>It is however certain that hops were known in the time of
the Carolingian dynasty, for a letter of donation by King
Pepin speaks of <i>humolariæ</i>, which without doubt must have
been <span class="locked">hop-gardens<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a></span>. In like manner Adelard, abbot of Corbey,
in the year 822, freed the millers belonging to his district
from all labour relating to hops, and on this occasion
employed the words <i>humlo</i> and <i>brace</i>, by which is to be understood
corn and malt used for beer. In the Frisingen collection
of ancient documents, there are many which were written
in the time of Ludovicus Germanicus, consequently in the
middle of the ninth century; and in some of these, hop-gardens,
which were then called <i>humularia</i>, are <span class="locked">mentioned<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a></span>. In the tax
registers of the two following centuries, among the articles
delivered to churches and monasteries, <i>modii</i> and <i>moldera
humuli</i> are very often <span class="locked">named<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a></span>. Hop-fields and the delivery
of hops occur much oftener in the thirteenth century, under
the appellations <i>humuleta</i>, <i>humileta</i>, and <i>humularia</i><a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a>. In the
<span class="locked">Sachsenspiegel<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a></span> and the municipal law of Magdeburg (Weichbildsrechte<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a>),
there is an order in regard to the hop-plants
which grew over hedges. I shall omit the still more numerous
instances where they occur in the fourteenth century as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
well as the proofs that hops were then cultivated in many
parts of Germany; and it is perhaps true, as said by Möhsen,
and after him by Fischer, on whose bare word however I do
not entirely rely, that many towns in Germany were indebted
for the great sale of their beer to the use of hops (which undoubtedly
appears to be a German discovery), and to their
peculiar goodness. However, it is certain that this method
of seasoning beer was adopted at a much later period by our
neighbours the English, Dutch, Swedes, and others.</p>

<p>If the two passages above quoted, where the word <i>lupuli</i>
occurs, be rejected because they are doubtful, I must consider
this name of hops to be more modern than the word
<i>humulus</i>; and if this be true, it is impossible to believe, with
Du Cange, that the latter was formed from the first by throwing
away the initial letter. As yet I had not found the name
<i>lupulus</i> given to hops earlier than the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>About this time lived Simon of Genoa, commonly called
<i>Johannes de Janua</i> or <i>Januensis</i>, who also had the surname
of <i>Cordus</i>. He was physician to Pope Nicholas IV.; afterwards
chaplain and sub-deacon to Pope Boniface VIII.; and
therefore flourished at the end of the thirteenth century. Of
his writings none is better known, or was formerly more
esteemed, than his Catholicon, a book in which he describes, in
alphabetical order, all the substances then used in medicine,
and on which, as he says himself, he was employed thirty
years. In this dictionary, which is commonly considered as
the first of the Materia medica, there is an article under the
head <i>lupulus</i>, copied however from the before-mentioned
Latin translation of Mesue, but with the addition, that this
plant by the French and Germans is named <i>humilis</i>, and that
the flowers of it were used in a beverage which he calls <i>medo</i><a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a>.
This Italian, however, does not seem to have been properly
acquainted with the subject; for he tells us <span class="locked">himself<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a></span>, that
under the name <i>medo</i> or mead, is understood a beverage made
of diluted honey, for which hops are never employed. In
Italy also, at that time, hops were not in use. About the
same period, Arnold de Villanova, in his commentary on the
work on Regimen, published by John of Milan, in the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
of the celebrated school of Salerno, mentions <i>lupuli</i>, and the
use of them in brewing <span class="locked">beer<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a></span>.</p>

<p>Professor Tychsen, to whose friendship I have been frequently
indebted for assistance in my researches, suggested
to me the conjecture that <i>lupulus</i> perhaps is derived from
<i>lupinus</i>, because Columella says that the bitter seeds of this
plant were added, in Egypt, to beer in order to moderate its
<span class="locked">sweetness<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a></span>. This use is confirmed also by G. W. Lorsbach,
from the Arabic historian Ebn <span class="locked">Chalican<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a></span>. At any rate, this
proves that in Egypt at that time bitter things began to be
added to beer. It is also well known that in Italy lupines
were rendered fit for the use of man as well as of animals, by
macerating them in <span class="locked">water<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a></span>; and I am of opinion, that on this
account Varro required water to be in the neighbourhood of
a <span class="locked">farm-yard<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a></span>. Lupines softened in water are still employed
for making dough. But if <i>lupulus</i> was formed from <i>lupinus</i>,
it must however be proved that the use of it for beer was
common beyond the boundaries of Egypt. Even if we admit
with Schöttgen, that the poet employs <i>zythum</i> for beer in
general, this beverage was never used in Italy, and I have
met with no other mention of lupines in brewing.</p>

<p>In the breweries of the Netherlands, hops seem to have
been first known in the beginning of the fourteenth century;
for about this time we find many complaints that the new
method of brewing with hops lessened the consumption of
<i>gruit</i>, and also the income arising from <i>gruitgeld</i>. The word
<i>gruit</i> seems to have many meanings: in the first place it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
signifies malt; but though I formerly considered this as the
proper meaning, and though some approved my opinion, I
must confess that on further examination I am not able fully
to prove it. In the second place, it signified a certain tax
paid at each time of brewing: thirdly, a certain addition of
herbs used for beer in the fourteenth century: and in the
last place, the beer brewed with it was itself sometimes called
<i>gruit</i>.</p>

<p>That this word always denoted malt is impossible; for it is
said that after hops were introduced, less <i>gruit</i> was used and
sold than formerly had been the case. But how could hops
be employed instead of malt? John, bishop of Liege and
Utrecht, complained to the emperor Charles IV., that for
thirty or forty years a new method of brewing, that is to say,
with the addition of a certain plant called <i>humulus</i> or <i>hoppa</i>,
had been introduced, and that his income arising from <i>gruitgeld</i>
had been thereby much lessened. The emperor, therefore,
in the year 1364, permitted him, for the purpose of
making good his loss, to demand a <i>groschen</i> for each cask of
hops; and this right was confirmed to bishop Arnold by
pope <span class="locked">Gregory<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a></span>. By this and similar accounts I am induced
to conjecture that a beverage composed of different herbs
was at that time prepared, and that the sale of this mixture
and of <i>gruit</i> was converted into a so-called <i>regale</i>. Nay, it
almost appears that <i>gruit</i> was a fermenting substance, indispensably
necessary to beer, instead of the yeast used at
present.</p>

<p>According to every appearance the ancient beer could not
be long kept; and beer fit to be preserved seems to have
come into use after the introduction of hops. The oldest
writers who treat of the good and bad effects of hops, reckon
among the latter, that they dried up the body and increased
melancholy; but among their good qualities, they praise their
property of preserving liquors from <span class="locked">corruption<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a></span>. It was soon
remarked also, that the keeping of beer depended a great
deal on the season in which it was brewed; for M. Anton
quotes from the Ilm statutes of 1350, that people were permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
to brew only from Michaelmas to St. Walpurgis’ <span class="locked">day<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a></span>;
at other times it was forbidden under certain penalties. At
that period various kinds of beer seem to have been in use,
and perhaps became fashionable instead of wine, coffee,
and tea. Thus M. Anton quotes, from a Hervord document
of the year 1144, <i>cervisia mellita</i> and <i>non mellita</i>. However,
even at present, honey is used for many kinds of beer;
such for example as that brewed at Nimeguen, which has an
extensive sale under the name of <i>moll</i>, a word derived no
doubt from <i>mollig</i>, mild; which is applied also to wine. In
the same manner the English used liquorice.</p>

<p>In England, the use of hops seems to have been introduced
at a much later period; but it is said that they were at first
considered as a dangerous production, and that the planting
of them was forbidden in the reign of Henry VI., about the
middle of the fifteenth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a></span>. This I will not venture to
deny, though I very much doubt it. I have found no proof
of it in any English writer, and I have searched in vain for
the prohibition among the orders of that prince, in which
however there occurs one in regard to <span class="locked">malt<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a></span>. On the contrary,
many English historians assert that the use of hops was
first made known in England by some people from Artois, in
the reign of Henry VIII., or about the year <span class="locked">1524<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a></span>. It is
nevertheless true, that this sovereign, in an order respecting
the servants of his household, in the twenty-second year of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
his reign, that is in 1530, forbade brewers to put into ale
hops and <span class="locked">sulphur<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a></span>. But perhaps his majesty was not fond of
hopped beer. Even at present, most of the dictionaries call
ale, beer brewed without hops; and an English physician
says expressly that the difference between ale and beer is,
that hops are not employed for the <span class="locked">former<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a></span>. But according
to the English instructions for brewing, hops are required
for ale also.</p>

<p>In the English laws hops are mentioned for the first time
in the fifth year of the reign of Edward VI., that is in 1552,
at which period some privileges were granted to <i>hop-grounds</i>.
The cultivation of hops however, which, like the art of
brewing, has in England been carried to the greatest perfection,
was very limited even in the beginning of the seventeenth
century; for James I., in the fifth year of his reign,
that is in 1603, found it necessary to forbid, under severe
penalties, the introduction and use of spoilt and adulterated
hops. At that time, therefore, England did not produce a
quantity sufficient for its own consumption.</p>

<p>In Sweden, at least in the fifteenth century, hops seem not
to have been very <span class="locked">common<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a></span>; for at that time sweet gale
(<i>Myrica gale</i>) was employed for beer; and so generally, that
king Christopher, in 1440, confirmed the old law, that those
who collected this plant before a certain period, on any
common or on another person’s land, should be subjected to
a fine. A similar punishment however was appointed for the
too early picking of hops; and the cultivation of them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
so strongly enforced, that every farmer who had not forty
poles with hops growing round them was punished, unless he
could show that his land was unfit for producing <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a></span>.</p>

<p>But it was long doubted in Sweden whether this plant
would thrive in the cold climate of that country; in which
however it grows wild. In the time of Gustavus I., who became
king in 1523, Sweden was obliged to give for the
foreign hops it used 1200 <i>schifpfunds</i> of iron, which was
about the ninth part of all the iron made in the kingdom.
In the year 1558 the king complained, in an edict, that a
pound of hops cost as much as a barrel of malt, and on that
account was desirous to encourage the cultivation of the
hop-plant. But his exertions were attended with so little
effect, that even under the reign of queen Christina, that is,
in the middle of the seventeenth century, all the hops used
in the kingdom were imported from Germany, and particularly
from Brunswick and Saxony. The queen had some
hop plantations as rarities in her garden; yet the cultivation
of hops was begun under this princess, and carried so far
that German hop farmers, who before had been accustomed
to travel to Sweden every three years, to receive payment
and take new orders, returned very much dissatisfied, and
suffered a part of their hop-grounds to run to waste. Under
Charles XI., however, who reigned from 1660 to 1697, the
cultivation of hops was first brought to a state of considerable
improvement.</p>

<p>In the year 1766, Linnæus hazarded a conjecture that
hops, spinage, chenopodium, tarragon, and many other garden
vegetables were brought to Europe by the Goths, during
their periods of emigration, from Russia and particularly the
Ukraine, because the old writers make no mention of these
plants, and because in those districts they all grow wild at
<span class="locked">present<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a></span>. It however appears certain that hops belong to
our indigenous plants, as they grow everywhere wild in Germany,
Switzerland, England, and Sweden, and even in countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
into which the cultivation of them has never yet been
introduced, and where it cannot be supposed that they accidentally
became wild by being conveyed from hop-fields and
gardens. The want of information in works older than the
emigrations of the northern tribes, is no proof that a plant
did not then exist. At that time there was no Linnæus to
transmit plants to posterity, as Hipparchus, according to the
expression of Pliny, did the stars. Such vegetable productions
only as had become remarkable on account of their
utility or hurtful qualities, or by some singular circumstance,
occur in the works of the ancients. Many others remained
unknown, or at least without names, till natural history acquired
a systematic form; and even at present botanists
have often the satisfaction to discover some plant not before
observed.</p>

<p>Is it probable that the Chinese even are acquainted with
our hops? They have a kind of beer made from barley and
wheat, which is called <i>tarasun</i>; and according to the account
of J. G. Gmelin, who purposely made himself acquainted
with the preparation of it, hops formed by pressure into
masses, shaped like a brick, are added to <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a></span>. It is well
known that the Chinese have also a kind of tea formed into
cakes by strong pressure. Our hops are compressed in the
same manner in Bohemia; and in that state will keep without
losing any of their strength for fifty years. They are
put into a sack or bag of coarse canvass, and subjected to a
press. A square sewed bag, each side of which is two ells,
contains fifty bushels of hops prepared in this manner; and
when any of them are required for brewing, the bag is made
fast to a beam, and as much as may be necessary is cut out
with an axe. The whole mass is of a brown colour, and has
a resemblance to pitch, in which not a single hop-leaf can be
distinguished. Whether the Chinese conceived the idea of
employing our common hops for the like purpose, is a question
of some importance in regard to the history of them;
but at present I am not able to answer it.</p>

<p>[Hops are extensively cultivated in Kent, Sussex, and
Herefordshire; and to a less extent in Worcestershire,
Wiltshire, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Surrey, and several
other counties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
From 50,000 to 60,000 acres of land are covered in England
with hop-gardens, about one-half being in Kent; an
excise duty of 18<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per cwt. is levied upon their produce.
British hops are exported to Hamburg, Antwerp, St. Petersburg,
New York, Australia, and other places. A trifling
quantity is also imported, principally from Flanders. The
duty on hops of the growth of Great Britain produced in
1842, £260,979.]</p>

<h2 id="black">BLACK LEAD.</h2>

<p>To ascertain how old the use of black lead is for writing
might be of some importance in diplomatics, as the antiquity
of manuscripts ruled or written with this substance, or of
drawings made with it, could then be determined.</p>

<p>I allude here to pencils formed of that mineral called, in
common, <i>plumbago</i> and <i>molybdæna</i>, though a distinction is
now made between these names by mineralogists. The mineral
used for black-lead pencils they call <i>reissbley</i>, <i>plumbago</i>,
or <i>graphites</i>; but under the term <i>wasserbley</i> and <i>molybdæna</i>
they understand a mineral once considered to be the same as
the former, but which, however like it may be in appearance,
differs from it in being heavier, occurring much seldomer, and
containing a new metal, almost of a steel-grey colour, exceedingly
brittle, and named <i>molybdænum</i>. Plumbago, which
is the substance here meant, when exposed to an open fire, is
almost entirely consumed, leaving nothing but a little iron
and siliceous earth. It contains no lead; and the names
<i>reissbley</i> and <i>bleystift</i> have no other foundation than the lead-coloured
traces which it leaves upon paper. The darker,
finer, and cleaner the lines it makes are, the fitter it is for
drawing and writing. These lines are durable, and do not
readily fade; but when one chooses, they may be readily
rubbed out. Black lead, therefore, can be used with more
convenience and speed than any coloured earth, charcoal,
or even ink.</p>

<p>It is well known that transcribers, more than a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
years ago, when they wished their writing to be in a particular
manner beautiful and regular, drew fine parallel lines, which
they followed in writing. These lines may be still clearly
distinguished in old manuscripts. In many instances, they
have only been impressed on the parchment by some hard,
sharp body; but they often exhibit a leaden colour; from
which one might suppose that they had been drawn with our
plumbago, and consequently believe that the use of this substance
is as old as we must consider, from certain marks, the
oldest ruled manuscripts. But, on a little reflection, one will
be convinced that this would be a very fallacious conclusion.
For lines so like those made with plumbago, that the eye can
scarcely perceive the difference, may be made with <span class="locked">lead<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a></span>.</p>

<p>It can be proved that the ancients drew their lines with
lead; and this could be done with more convenience, as this
soft metal was easily rubbed off by the parchment, which,
being harder and rougher than our paper, had therefore more
body. It is well known that, formerly, when people wished
to draw lines, a small round plate of lead, which could not so
readily cut the parchment or become bent as a leaden style,
was <span class="locked">employed<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a></span>.</p>

<p>Old manuscripts, ruled with lead-coloured lines, have been
pointed out by modern diplomatists. Our learned Professor
Schönemann, who was unfortunately hurried off by a premature
death, has given a description of the Codex Berengaris
Turonensis, of the eleventh or twelfth century, and the Codex
Theophyli Presbyteri de Temperamento Colorum of the
latter century, both preserved in the library of Wolfenbuttel;
and remarks that lines are drawn on the first partly with a
style and partly in a light manner with lead; but he says of
the other, that it exhibits very fine lines drawn with a black-lead
<span class="locked">pencil<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a></span>. Le Moine quotes a document of the year 1387,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
which is ruled with black lead, and at the same time says
that the custom of ruling ceased about the year 1421 and
1424. The lines, therefore, after that period, became crooked
and <span class="locked">oblique<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a></span>.</p>

<p>But the antiquity of black-lead pencils cannot be determined
by the help of diplomatic documents. It might be
traced out with more ease were it known by what mineralogical
writer <i>plumbago</i>, and the uses of it, were first mentioned.
The following is what I have remarked on this subject; but
I suspect that there must be some older mention of it than any
I have yet been able to find. I do not, however, believe that
those who require more than bare conjecture will discover
this mineral in the works of the Greeks and the Romans; for
it cannot possibly be proved that it is to be understood under
the terms <i>plumbago</i>, <i>galena</i>, <i>molybdæna</i>, and <i>molybdoides</i>, as
has been confidently asserted by many, who, were it not superfluous,
might easily be refuted. But in whatever obscurity
these names may be involved, one can with certainty discover
that they sometimes denote <i>galena</i>, or a real lead ore, or else
some production of lead works.</p>

<p>The first author in whose writings I have as yet found
certain mention of <i>plumbago</i> is Conrad Gesner, whose name
I can never pronounce without respect. In his book on fossils,
printed at Zurich in 1565, he says that people had pencils
for writing which consisted of a wooden handle, with a
piece of lead, or, as he believed, an artificial mixture, called
by some <i>stimmi Anglicanum</i>. Such pencils must at that
time have been scarce, because he has given a figure of them
in a wood-cut. To judge by this, the pencil seems to have
had a wooden sheath or covering.</p>

<p>Thirty years after, Cæsalpinus gave a more complete account
of this mineral, which he calls <i>molybdoides</i>, because he
thinks it was so named by Dioscorides. He says that it was
a lead-coloured shining stone, as smooth as if rubbed over
with oil; it gave to the fingers an ash-grey tint, with a plumbeous
lustre, and pointed pencils were made of it for the use
of painters and draftsmen. He adds, that it was called Flanders’
stone, because it was brought from the Netherlands to
<span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Three years after Cæsalpinus, a still better description was
given by Imperato. The latter calls the black lead <i>grafio
piombino</i>, and says that it is much more convenient for
drawing than pen and ink, because the marks made with it
appear not only on a white ground, but, in consequence of
their brightness, show themselves also on black; because
they can be preserved or rubbed out at pleasure; and because
one can retrace them with a pen, which drawings made with
lead or charcoal will not <span class="locked">admit<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a></span>. This mineral is smooth;
appears greasy to the touch, and has a leaden colour, which
it communicates with a sort of metallic lustre. It can resist
for a long time the strongest fire; it even acquires in it more
hardness, and therefore has been considered as a kind of talc.
Sometimes it is foliaceous, and may be crumbled to pieces in
scales; but it is frequently found denser and stronger, and
in this case writing-pencils are made of it. The first kind
was mixed with that clay called <i>rubrica</i>, and manufactured
into crucibles, which were exceedingly durable in the fire.
It is here seen that these Italians, at that time, were well acquainted
with this mineral. It has been reckoned a species
of talc by Justi, by Wallerius in the first edition of his mineralogy,
and also by others. Its durability in resisting heat
is certainly manifested, when it is kept in a close fire and between
coals. But it is proved by the experiments of modern
mineralogists, that in an open, strong, and long-continued
fire, it becomes almost entirely consumed.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Ambrosinus, in the continuation of Aldrovandi’s
Musæum Metallicum, printed at Bologna in 1648,
uses the name <i>lapis plumbarius</i>. The short account which
he gives of it has been borrowed from the two Italians last
mentioned; but it deserves to be remarked, that even then he
thought it worth his while to give Gesner’s figure enlarged.</p>

<p>In the works of Albertus Magnus, George Agricola, Encelius,
Cæsius, Kircher, and many other old mineralogists, I
have found no mention of black lead. But as the advantageous
use of it for crucibles was known to Imperato, and as the
crucibles made at Ips, which till very lately were employed
by all the mints in Europe, and even in other parts, derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
their superiority from plumbago being mixed with the blue
clay, and as these crucibles are introduced more than once by
Agricola without any mention of the addition, it must either
at that time have not been usual, or it must have escaped the
notice of this diligent man. How old then are the pits at
Leizersdorf, which furnish plumbago for the crucibles of Ips
or Passau? I know of one mineralogist only who has described
that district, but on this subject he has given us no
information.</p>

<p>I am equally unacquainted with the time when the pits in
Cumberland, which, as is well known, produce the best plumbago,
were discovered. They are situated on the Borrowdale
mountains, about ten miles from the town of Keswick. The
families to whom these pits belong, according to an established
regulation, can open them only once every seven years, and
take out but a certain quantity of the mineral, in order to
keep up the price, and prevent the pits from being <span class="locked">exhausted<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a></span>.
This production is called there <i>black lead</i>, <i>kellow</i> or <i>killow</i>,
<i>wad</i> or <i>wadt</i>, which words properly mean <span class="locked">black<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a></span>. I have
found no older information in regard to these pits than that
of Merret, who wrote in the year 1667, and who calls this
mineral <i>nigrica fabrilis</i>, because it had then no Latin <span class="locked">name<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a></span>.
Pettus remarked, in his Fleta Minor, published 1683, that
the pencils made from it were inclosed in fir or cedar. It is
related by <span class="locked">Robinson<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a></span> and others, that at first the country-people
around Keswick marked their sheep with it. Afterwards
the art was discovered of employing it for earthenware,
and for preserving iron from rust. The last-mentioned author
says also, that it is used by the Dutch in dyeing, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
render black more durable, and that it is bought up by them
in large quantities for that purpose. But this is only a pretence.
I am inclined to think that they prepare from it black-lead
pencils.</p>

<p>The greater part of the plumbago at present used in commerce,
but which, as far as I know, is fit only for iron-black,
comes from Spain, where it is dug up in the neighbourhood
of Ronda, a town in Grenada, a few miles distant from the
sea; but, in regard to the antiquity of these pits, I have found
no information. In commerce, it is called <i>potloth</i>; and the
mills, such as those at Bremen, where it is ground fine, are
named <i>potloth</i> mills, an appellation which in all probability
has been borrowed from the Dutch, among whom <i>potloot</i>
signifies as much as potters’ lead. From this word the French
have made <i>potelot</i>, which however in many dictionaries is
omitted. If I am not mistaken, this mineral was first found
in France at a very late period in Upper Provence, near Curban,
and not far from the river Durance, between Sisteron
and Gap, from which it is sent to Marseilles.</p>

<p>It appears to me probable, that in the sixteenth century
the use of plumbago was first introduced into Italy, a country
which abounds with draftsmen and drawing-schools; where
other minerals had been long used for drawing, and where
the best kinds had been carefully sought out. It is likely,
therefore, that some one may have made a trial with plumbago,
induced by its appearance; and indeed nothing but a
trial was necessary to show its superiority to charcoal, and to
black and red chalk. I am inclined to think also, that the
earliest mention of it will be found in the oldest Italian works
on drawing, rather than in those on mineralogy, to the authors
of which this substance first became known by its use. For
a long time, all the black-lead pencils employed in Germany
and in the neighbouring countries were made at Nuremberg.
I shall here observe, that the very convenient method of wiping
out writing made with a black-lead pencil, by means of Indian
rubber, was discovered about twenty or thirty years ago, and,
as I believe, first in England.</p>

<p>After I had completed this article, Professor Fiorillo, who
as an artist has studied the master-pieces, and as a man of
letters the writings of the Italians, communicated to me, at
my request, the following information, which at any rate will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
form an additional fragment towards the history of drawing.
The pencils first used in Italy for drawing were composed of
a mixture of lead and tin fused together, and the proportion
was two parts of the former and one of the <span class="locked">latter<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a></span>. To obliterate
a drawing or piece of writing, it was rubbed over with
crumbs of bread. A pencil of this kind was called <i>stile</i>. Petrarch
has immortalized a painter named Simone Memmi by
a couple of sonnets, out of gratitude for a picture of his beloved
<span class="locked">Laura<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a></span>. In these he says that the artist made the
drawing with a <i>stile in carte</i>. The author here evidently
alludes to a drawing-pencil, and not to a graver, as some have
supposed. Boccacio, a scholar of Petrarch, celebrates an artist
who was equally expert at drawing with the <i>stile</i>, the pen,
and the pencil. Michael Angelo also, who died in 1564, says,
in a sonnet on Vasari, quoted by Fiorillo, “Se con lo stile e co’
colori avete.” Such pencils were long used also in Germany;
and formerly they were found at the most common writing-desks.</p>

<p>The use of red and black chalk seems to be more modern.
The former is called by the Italians <i>matita rossa</i>, and the latter
<i>matita nera</i>. This name is derived from <i>hæmatites</i>. Vasari
celebrates Baccio Bondinelli, who died in the middle of
the sixteenth century, because he could handle equally well
<i>lo stile, e la penna, e la matita rossa e nera</i>. Baldinucci says,
that the best red chalk comes from Germany; good black
chalk from France; but the very best from Spain, whence
that of the first quality is obtained at present.</p>

<p>I can, however, point out no mention of our plumbago in
the works of the old Italian artists. Armenini, who wrote at
the end of the sixteenth century, relates how pupils were
taught to draw a hundred years before his <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a></span>. He says
that they made the first sketches with <i>piombo over cannella
col lapis nero</i>, and afterwards filled them up with a pen. But
when his whole description is read, there can remain no doubt
that the substance here meant is black chalk. Baldinucci,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
who did not write till 1681, has introduced particularly into
his dictionary <i>matita rossa</i>, <i>nera</i>, and also <i>lapis piombino</i>;
and says that the last-mentioned is an artificial production,
which gives a leaden colour, and is employed for drawing.
It is evident therefore that the author here alludes to plumbago,
which was then very common. But when Bottari <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a></span>
that artists first began to use red and black chalk in the time
of Vasari, whereas <i>lapis piombino</i> only was employed before
that period, he has named <i>plumbago</i>, commonly used in his
time, instead of the metallic pencil which was called <i>stile</i>. If
I am not mistaken, the Italians have no proper appellation
for black lead, but call it sometimes <i>matita</i> and sometimes
<i>piombino</i>.</p>

<p>[Great difficulty was formerly experienced in protecting
the Borrowdale black-lead mine from robbery. At present,
the treasure is protected by a strong building, consisting of
four rooms upon the ground floor; and immediately under
one of them is the opening, secured by a trap-door, through
which workmen alone can enter the interior of the mountain.
In this apartment, called the dressing-room, the miners change
their ordinary clothes for their working-dress as they come
in; and after their six hours, post or journey, they again
change their dress, under the superintendence of the steward,
before they are allowed to go out. In the innermost of the
four rooms two men are seated at a large table, sorting and
dressing the plumbago, who are locked in while at work, and
watched by the steward from an adjoining room, who is armed
with two loaded blunderbusses. In some years the net produce
of the <i>six weeks’</i> annual working of the mine has, it is
said, amounted to from 30,000<i>l.</i> to 40,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>An inferior kind of plumbago is imported from Mexico
and Ceylon; and a composition with which more common
pencils are manufactured is made of a mixture of plumbago-powder,
lamp black and clay.</p>

<p>A useful and convenient application of the black lead in
the form of minute cylinders which slightly projected from a
cylindrical cone, and which was fitted to a pencil-case, was
patented in 1822 by Mr. Mordan, and has come into general
use: the cylindrical form of the plumbago is produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
passing square strips of it through holes in a ruby, somewhat
in the manner of wire-drawing. It is stated that the supply
of plumbago from the Cumberland mine is almost exhausted;
fortunately, a process has been devised by which the same
firmness and equality may be communicated to the powder
by compression. This is effected by carefully washing and
grinding the dust obtained in sawing plumbago into thin
plates, sifting it through spaces less than the 1/50000th part of
an inch, and placing it under a powerful press, on a strong die
or bed of steel, with air-tight fittings. The air is then pumped
from the dust, and while thus freed from air, a plunger descends
upon it and it becomes solidified. The power employed
to perform this operation is estimated at 1000 tons,
several blows having been given, each of this power. This
process was invented by Mr. W. Brockedon, the talented
draftsman of Alpine and Italian scenery.]</p>

<h2 id="sal">SAL-AMMONIAC.</h2>

<p>It is not very probable that Dioscorides, Pliny, and others
who lived nearly about the same time, were acquainted with
sal-ammoniac, or mentioned it in their works; for no part of
mineralogy was then so defective as that which is the most
important, and which treats of salts. The art of lixiviating
earths and causing saline solutions to crystallize was then so
little known, that, instead of green vitriol, vitriolic minerals,
however impure, were employed in making ink, dye-liquors,
and other things. Places for boiling vitriol were not then
established, and therefore Pliny beheld with wonder blue vitriol,
which in his time was made only in Spain, as a thing
singular in its kind, or which had not its like. On this account
those salts only were known which occur in a native
state, or which crystallize as it were of themselves, without
any artificial preparation, as is the case with bay salt. But
that neutral salt, formed of muriatic acid and ammonia, occurs
very seldom in a native state, and almost exclusively among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
the productions of volcanoes. I do not, however, suppose
that this volcanic sal-ammoniac was the first known, but that
it was first considered to be sal-ammoniac after that salt had
been long obtained by another method, and long used.</p>

<p>But even if it should be believed that our sal-ammoniac
was known to the ancients, how are we to discover it with
certainty in their writings? This salt has little or nothing
by which these writers could characterize it. Neither its external
form nor taste is so striking that it could be described
by them with sufficient precision. The use of it also could
not at that time be so important and necessary, as to enable
us to determine whether they were acquainted with it;
whereas, on the other hand, green vitriol and alum can easily
be distinguished among the materials for dyeing.</p>

<p>Nay, if this salt had been then made, as it is made at present
in Egypt, and if any allusion to it were found, one might
readily conjecture that sal-ammoniac were really meant. But
even though it must be admitted that traces of sublimation
being employed occur in the writings of Dioscorides and
others, who lived nearly at the same period, we are not authorized
to suppose that the knowledge of it was sufficient for
the preparation of this salt.</p>

<p>Besides, there are two properties with which the ancients
might have accidentally become acquainted, and which in
that case would have been sufficient to make known or define
to us this salt. In the first place, by an accidental mixture
of quicklime, the strong smell or unsupportable vapour
diffused by the volatile alkali separated from the acid might
have been observed. In the second place, it is very possible
that the complete volatilization of this salt on burning coals
may have been remarked; for it had been long known that
common salt decrepitates in the fire. This excited wonder, and
in examining other salts people were accustomed to observe
whether they possessed that property also. Had any one, with
this view, thrown a bit of sal-ammoniac on a burning coal,
he must have seen with astonishment that instead of decrepitating
it became entirely volatilized. For this experiment,
however, very pure sal-ammoniac would have been necessary.
Had a little common salt been mixed with it, decrepitation
would not have been altogether prevented; and if the
sal-ammoniac had been rendered impure by earthy particles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
as is almost always the case with the volcanic, some earth at
least would have remained behind on the coals.</p>

<p>The name <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> is indeed old; but as those who,
in consequence of the name, considered the <i>alumen</i> of the
ancients to be our alum, and their <i>nitrum</i> to be our saltpetre,
were in an error, we should be equally so were we to consider
their sal-ammoniac to be the same as ours. Our forefathers
believed that the ancient writers were acquainted with
all minerals, as well as with all plants; and when they discovered
a new one, they searched in old books till they found a
name which would suit it, or which at any rate had not been
given to another. Our sal-ammoniac, in all probability, acquired
in the same manner its name, which is not often to be
found in the writings of the <span class="locked">ancients<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a></span>.</p>

<p>When everything they have said of it is collected and impartially
examined, no proofs will be found that under that
name they understood our sal-ammoniac. On the contrary,
one will soon be convinced that <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> was nothing
else than impure marine salt. As the ancients were not acquainted
with the art of separating salts, of refining and crystallising
them, they gave to each variety or kind in the least
different, which was distinguished either by the intermixture
of some foreign substance or by an accidental formation, a
particular name; and, considering the wants of that period,
this method was not so bad. For among the impure saline
substances, there were always some which were found to be
fitter than others for certain purposes. On this account they
distinguished with so much care <i>misy</i>, <i>sory</i>, <i>chalcitis</i> and <i>melanteria</i>,
instead of which we use a substance contained in
all these minerals, that is to say, green vitriol. Our apothecary
shops however have at present the lixivious salt under
the name of various plants, from which it is extracted, with
different degrees of purity.</p>

<p>When this is known, it will excite no wonder that the <i>sal-ammoniacus</i>
of the ancients was nothing else than our common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
salt. Dioscorides and Pliny speak of it expressly as a
kind of this salt; and <span class="locked">Columella<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a></span>, in a prescription for an
eye-salve, recommends rock-salt, either Spanish, Ammoniacal,
or Cappadocian. Pliny <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a></span> that <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> was
found in the dry sandy deserts of Africa, as far as the oracle
of Ammon. It is stated, both by him and <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a></span>, that
this salt can be split or broken into smooth pieces; and the
former adds, that the best are white and transparent; that it
however has an unpleasant taste, but can be used in medicine.
In like manner later physicians, when they wish to
prescribe common salt, recommend in particular the ammoniac.
Thus Aetius, who lived in the fifth century, remarks,
that when fossil, or as we say at present native salt, is employed,
ammoniac or Cappadocian ought to be chosen.</p>

<p>From what is said by Pliny, it may with certainty be concluded
that this salt was dug up from pits or mines in Africa;
for he relates, that it appeared wonderful that a piece of it,
which in the pit was very light, became, on exposure to the
open air, much heavier. Without repeating the explanation
which he gives of this phænomenon, I shall only remark, that
many kinds of rock-salt, taken from the mines of Wieliczka,
experience the same change in the air; so that blocks which
a labourer can easily carry in the mine, can scarcely be lifted
by him after they have been some time exposed to the air.
The cause here is undoubtedly the same as that which makes
many kinds of artificial salt to become moist and to acquire
more weight. In this case it is owing to some impurity, such
as muriate of lime, which is called <i>sal-ammoniacus fixus</i><a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a>,
and which attracts from the atmosphere so much moisture,
that it deliquesces in it to the so-called oil of lime.</p>

<p>Synesius, who was born in Egypt in the fifth century, in
the Pentapolitan town Cyrene, and who resided as bishop in
Ptolemais, the capital of the district, says, in a letter wherein
he describes many rarities of his native country, that what
was called <i>sal-ammoniacus</i><a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a>, both according to its appearance
and taste, was a salt of a good quality, fit for use; that
it lay under a soft kind of stone which covered it like a crust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
and that it could be easily dug up when this stone was removed.</p>

<p>Herodotus, Strabo, Arrian, and others, speak of rock-salt
which was dug up in Ammonia, and carried thence as an
article of merchandise. The first mentions a hill of salt;
and we are told by the last, that native salt was brought to
Egypt as a present to the king and others, from the neighbourhood
of the oracle of Ammon, by the priests of that
place, in boxes made of palms worked together. Many
pieces were three inches in length; and because this substance
was purer than bay salt, and as clear as crystal, it was
particularly employed in sacrifices. This salt is certainly
that which, under the name of <i>sal-ammoniacus</i>, was sent
from Egypt to the king of Persia, like the water of the Nile,
as is related by Athenæus from an historian long since <span class="locked">lost<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is also certain that the old Arabian physicians, Avicenna
and Serapion, who both lived in the eleventh century, under
the name <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> understood nothing else than rock-salt.
The former says that it ought to split easily, and to be
clear and transparent like crystal; and the latter states that
this salt is cut from the solid rock, and that it is sometimes
clear as crystal, sometimes reddish, sometimes blackish, sometimes
of another colour, sometimes hard, and sometimes friable,
or, as the translator expresses it, pulverulent. All these
colours and properties are not uncommon in rock-salt, and
always proceed, no doubt, from an admixture of ferruginous
earth. Serapion says that this salt was obtained from Corasini.
I shall leave it to others to determine where this country
was situated. He often names it, and says that <i>mala
granata</i> and <i>bezaar</i> were obtained from it. But who knows
how the name was written in the original? And the Arabian
author perhaps did not mention the place where the
salt was dug up, but that from which, in his time, it was
<span class="locked">procured<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a></span>.</p>

<p>In regard to the purpose to which the ancients applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
their <i>sal-ammoniacus</i>, it appears that it required only common
salt and not sal-ammoniac. It is oftenest mentioned by
the physicians, because it was the purest table salt that could
then be procured. On that account it has been praised by
Scribonius Largus, who lived in the first century, and by
Aetius who lived in the fifth, as well as by Avicenna, Serapion,
and others. I have however not yet met with it in the
writings of Hippocrates or Galen. In the works of the
Greek agriculturists it occurs in a recipe for the preparation
of a cement employed to close up wine <span class="locked">vessels<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a></span>. According
to a recipe of Apicius, in his book on cookery, <i>sal-ammoniacus</i>
was to be roasted. By these means this rock-salt lost its
water of crystallization and became stronger. On this account,
in Transylvania, Siberia, and other countries, before
it is brought to the table it is pounded and roasted. Of our
sal-ammoniac, however, were it roasted, very little would remain.
But whether the <i>ammonium</i> which Palladius recommends
for a <span class="locked">cement<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a></span> be that salt, I will not pretend to determine.
On the other hand, I have no hesitation to contradict
the old commentator on Ovid, who, in a passage where the
poet recommends <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> in making a cosmetic
water, understands the resin or gum of that name. Ovid
however had no intention that young women should lacker
themselves.</p>

<p>For the reasons therefore already mentioned, I am convinced
that the <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> of the ancients was rock-salt,
and not our <i>sal-ammoniac</i>. The oldest commentators also
on these writers had no idea of any other than rock-salt;
and it was not till a later period, when our sal-ammoniac was
introduced into commerce, and acquired that name, that the
most learned commentators began expressly to remark, that
the new sal-ammoniac, notwithstanding its appellation, was
different from the <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> of the ancients. As this
could not then be obtained, people used the former, which
they considered only as an artificial substitute for the latter,
though it was incapable of supplying its place. But in more
modern times, when our sal-ammoniac became common, and
physicians and mineralogists no longer took the trouble to
read the works of the ancients, some of them, if not the
greater part, spoke in such a manner as if our sal-ammoniac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
had been the <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> of the ancients; and it was
then generally believed that it had been, at any rate, known
and used since the time of Dioscorides and Pliny.</p>

<p>No one has maintained this with greater confidence and
zeal than F. I. W. Schröder<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a>, whose judgement however
was perverted by alchemistic conceits. According to his assertion,
the Egyptians practised from the earliest periods the
art of making sal-ammoniac, but they kept it a secret; and
he obscurely hints at the purpose for which these great chemists
used so much salt. He refers, on this occasion, to what
Pliny says of <i>flos salis</i><a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a>, in which he thinks he can find the
martial <span class="locked">sal-ammoniac<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a></span> flowers of our chemists, or the so-called
<i>flores salis ammoniaci martiales</i>. Those who cannot make
this discovery he declares to be ignorant and blind. This
decision, however, when the character of the person who gives
it is considered, cannot dissipate a single doubt. It is certain
that what Dioscorides and Pliny call <i>flos salis</i> has never yet
been defined. It was moist, oily, and saline; and in the
vessels, in which it was sent from Egypt, was grey at the top,
saffron-coloured at the bottom, and emitted a bad smell. The
most ingenious conjecture was that of <span class="locked">Cordus<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a></span>, who thought
that it might be <i>sperma ceti</i>; but though I should prefer this
opinion to that of Schröder, I must confess that, on the
grounds adduced by Matthioli and Conrad Gesner, it has too
much against it to be admitted as truth.</p>

<p>The first distinct traces of our sal-ammoniac which I have
yet met with are to be found in the works of the <span class="locked">Arabians<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a></span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
In a writing of Geber, there is a prescription how to purify
sal-ammoniac by sublimation, and in another a receipt for
making it; so that there can be no doubt that the author was
acquainted with our salt. But this furnishes very little towards
the history of it. The period when that celebrated
chemist lived is uncertain. If, as Leo <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a></span>, he flourished a
hundred years after Mahomet, that is to say in the eighth
century, his works must have been interpolated with many
additions, which criticism has not yet been able to separate.
Many of them cannot be of great antiquity; and the uncertainty
is increased by some of the editions differing from each
other in important passages. Whole sections, which some
have, are wanting in others; and the titles and order of the
books and sections are different almost in each. When the
same circumstances are found in several editions, it is observed
that they essentially differ. What, therefore, is now found in
the writings of Geber, as they are called, was certainly not
all known in the eighth century.</p>

<p>The same uncertainty prevails in regard to the chemical
works of Avicenna, who lived in the beginning of the eleventh
century, and who certainly treats of sal-ammoniac. But
when these are compared with the medical works of this author,
which are subject to no doubt, it is evidently perceived
that the former must have been the production of a very different
and much younger writer. In the works of the physician
Avicenna, <i>sal-ammoniacus</i> means always rock-salt. It
is worthy of remark, that Avicenna the chemist says, that sal-ammoniac
comes from Egypt, India, and Forperia.</p>

<p>We know with more certainty that Albucasis, or Bulcasis,
was acquainted with sal-ammoniac, as well as the method of
preparing it, which he describes, and also the preparation of
medicines in general, in his book often printed under the
title of <i>Liber servitoris</i><a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a>. However unintelligible the translation
often is, one can easily discover in what manner sublimation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
was formerly performed in earthen vessels. But the
period when this Arabian writer lived is doubtful, though it
is generally admitted that he died in the year 1122.</p>

<p>But whence did Europe obtain this salt, in the twelfth and
succeeding centuries? When and in what manner was the
preparation of it found out in Egypt? For what purpose
was it first used by our ancestors? I have not yet met with
any information to enable me to answer these questions,
though it is probable that it might be found in old books of
travels, and particularly in the works of Arabian writers. In
the valuable but not altogether intelligible book of <span class="locked">Pegolotti<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a></span>,
from which I have learned many things respecting the trade
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, nothing is said in
regard to the place where it was obtained, but that it was
procured in white, hard, and opake cakes. It is mentioned
in the custom-house tariff of Pisa for the year 1408.</p>

<p>Biringoccio, who lived in the end of the fifteenth and beginning
of the following <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a></span>, knew nothing more than
that, according to report, it came from Cyrene or Armenia.
Cæsalpin, his contemporary, gave, for the preparation of it,
a prescription which is undoubtedly borrowed from the Arabians.
This author says, very properly, that it is obtained
in white transparent cakes, blackish on the outside; but adds,
erroneously, that it comes from Germany, though the same
thing has been repeated by Brasavolus and Matthioli. Porta
says, with more truth, that it comes from the East. He asserts
also, that he was the first person who found real sal-ammoniac
on volcanic mountains, and he wishes that his discovery
might be confirmed by skilful <span class="locked">naturalists<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a></span>. This may
serve as an additional proof, were such necessary, in opposition
to those who think that the first real sal-ammoniac introduced
into commerce was the volcanic. Imperato considers
Porta’s observation as generally acknowledged, but without
naming him. The former has described, in a fuller and more
correct manner than any of his predecessors, the properties
of <span class="locked">sal-ammoniac<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a></span>; and he states, as does also <span class="locked">Agricola<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a></span>, that
it is entirely dissipated in the fire. He adds, that it promotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
the production of a celestial blue colour, and in all probability
he here alludes to a solution of copper.</p>

<p>Without attempting to examine at what time the art was
discovered of converting the nitric acid into aqua regia by
the addition of sal-ammoniac, I shall only remark that, at any
rate, it was known in the sixteenth century; for Imperato says
that sal-ammoniac is employed in the solution of gold; and
<span class="locked">Biringoccio<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a></span>, who is older, recommends nitrous acid prepared
with sal-ammoniac for dissolving metals, and particularly
gold. I will not either determine how old the use of this salt
is in soldering and tinning; but I must observe, that it was
known to <span class="locked">Agricola<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a></span> and Imperato. I however doubt whether
it was very common, because <span class="locked">Biringoccio<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a></span> recommends borax
for that purpose, without so much as mentioning sal-ammoniac;
though it is possible that I may have overlooked it.</p>

<p>We are now arrived at the modern history, which I shall
give in as brief a manner as I can, because it has been already
fully treated on by others. What was long ago shown by the
celebrated Mr. Boyle was proved in the year 1716 by Geoffroy
the younger, that sal-ammoniac was composed of the
muriatic acid and volatile alkali, and that it could be thence
prepared in Europe by <span class="locked">sublimation<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a></span>. In the same year the
jesuit Sicard gave the first certain account of the sal-ammoniac
manufactories at Damayer, in the Delta, and described in
what manner this salt was prepared there, by sublimation in
glass vessels, from the soot of the burnt dung of camels and
cows, which is used in Egypt for fuel, with the addition of
sea salt and <span class="locked">urine<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a></span>. In the year 1719, the Academy of
Sciences at Paris received from Lemere, the French consul
at Cairo, an account of the process employed; but it contained
no mention either of sea salt or of <span class="locked">urine<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a></span>. Afterwards this information
was in part confirmed, and in part rectified and
enlarged, by Paul <span class="locked">Lucas<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a></span>, Granger, or, as he was properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
called, <span class="locked">Tourtechot<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a></span>, and the celebrated travellers Shaw, Pocock,
Norden, Hasselquist, Niebuhr, and Mariti.</p>

<p>Several writers have asserted that sal-ammoniac comes also
from the East Indies. It is mentioned by Tavernier among
the wares which in his time were brought from Amadabat,
in the territories of the Mogul, to Surat; and Geoffroy states,
that when the trade of Marseilles was interrupted by the
plague, the French obtained from Holland sal-ammoniac,
which was shaped like a truncated cone, and was given out
to be <span class="locked">Indian<a name="FNanchor_1002" id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a></span>. Pomet also says, that some of the same kind
was formerly procured from Venice and Holland. But Gaubius
asserts that he was never able to hear of any such sal-ammoniac
in <span class="locked">Holland<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a></span>; nor is it to be found in the price
currents of the East India Company. I am almost inclined to
suspect that these truncated cones were formed by the merchants
from broken pieces or fragments of the Egyptian sal-ammoniac,
by solution and imperfect crystallization or sublimation.
In this manner the merchants at Marseilles convert
the refuse of the Egyptian sal-ammoniac into cakes by a new
sublimation, in order that it may become more saleable,
though it is not readily purchased by artists. Gaubius, however,
has described a kind of sal-ammoniac which he obtained
from India, with the information that it was made in Hindostan
from the soot of animal dung; but in my opinion this requires
further <span class="locked">confirmation<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a></span>.</p>

<p>Where and at what time the first works for making sal-ammoniac
were established in Europe, I am not able to determine.
The account given by Thurneisser, that the first
sal-ammoniac was made in the Tyrol in the ninth century, is
truly ridiculous. It is not worth the trouble to inquire where
he or Paracelsus found this foolish assertion. One might be
almost induced to believe, that in the time of Boyle there
were manufactories of sal-ammoniac in <span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a></span>. But perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
there may be no other foundation for all this than the
before-mentioned assertion of Cæsalpinus, that this salt came
from Germany. At Bamberg, the Germans were long accustomed
to boil the sediment of the salt-pans with old urine,
and to sell it cheap for sal-ammoniac; and Weber asserts
that some of the same kind is still made at Vienna. The
hundred weight costs from twenty to thirty florins, but the
refuse may be purchased for a mere trifle. If I am not mistaken,
the first real manufactories of sal-ammoniac were
established in Scotland; and the oldest of these, perhaps,
was that erected by Dovin and Hutton at Edinburgh in
1756, and which, like many in England, manufactures this
salt on a large <span class="locked">scale<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a></span>. Among the later undertakings of this
kind is Gravenhorst’s manufactory at Brunswick, and that
which in the neighbourhood of Gothenburg manufactures
sal-ammoniac from the refuse left in making train oil.</p>

<p>[Sal-ammoniac is now prepared either by the destructive
distillation of bones or coal. The gas-liquor supplies, we believe,
the largest part. This fluid contains hydrosulphuret and
carbonate with some other salts of ammonia. It is decomposed
with sulphuric acid, and on evaporation the sulphate
of ammonia is obtained in a crystalline state. This is then
mixed with common salt and the mixture heated in iron
vessels, whereupon the muriate of ammonia sublimes.</p>

<p>Sal-ammoniac is exported in considerable quantities to
Russia and other parts of the continent and to the United
States.]</p>

<h2 id="forks">FORKS.</h2>

<p>At present forks are so necessary at table among polished
nations, that the very idea of eating a meal without them
excites disgust. The introduction of them, however, is of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
modern a date, that they have scarcely been in use three
centuries. “Tam prope ab origine rerum sumus,” says Pliny,
in speaking of a thing which, though very new, was then
exceedingly common. Neither the Greeks nor the Romans
have any name for these instruments; and no phrase or expression
which, with the least probability, can be referred to
the use of them, occurs anywhere in their writings. But had
forks been known, this could not have been the case, since
so many entertainments are celebrated by the poets or described
by other writers; and they must also have been mentioned
by Pollux, in the very full catalogue which he has
given of articles necessary for the table.</p>

<p>The Greek word <i>creagra</i> signified indeed a fork, but not a
fork used at table. It meant merely a flesh-fork, or that instrument
employed by cooks to take meat from a boiling pot,
as is proved by the connexion of the words in all those passages
where it occurs. It is mentioned by Pollux, and by
Anaxippus, in Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a>, among the utensils of the kitchen;
and the scholiast on Aristophanes says that this fork had a
resemblance to the hand, and was used to prevent the fingers
from being scalded. Suidas quotes a passage where the word
denotes a hook at the end of a long pole, with which people,
even at present, draw up water-buckets from wells and other
deep places. This instrument, therefore, appears sometimes
to have had only a hook, but sometimes two or more prongs.
<i>Creagra</i> occurs once in Martianus Capella, a Latin writer,
but in a passage which is not intelligible.</p>

<p>Equally inapplicable to our forks are the words <i>furca</i>, <i>fuscina</i>,
<i>fucilla</i>, <i>fuscinula</i>, and <i>gabalus</i>, which are given in dictionaries.
The first two were undoubtedly instruments which
approached nearly to our furnace and hay forks. The trident
of Neptune also was called <i>fuscina</i>. The <i>furcilla</i> even
was large enough to be employed for a weapon of defence,
as is proved by the expressions <i>furcillis ejicere</i> and <i>expellere</i>.
<i>Fuscinula</i>, which in modern times is used chiefly for a table
fork, is not to be found even once in any of the old Latin
writers. The old translation of the Bible only explains the
word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κρεάγρα</span> by <i>fuscinula</i>. <i>Gabalus</i>, according to every
appearance, has given rise to the German word <i>gabeln</i>, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
denotes the cross or gallows, which last word Voscius deduces
from it.</p>

<p>A learned Italian, who asserts also that the use of forks is
very new, is of opinion that the Romans often used <i>ligulæ</i>
instead of <span class="locked">forks<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a></span>. This I shall not deny; but the <i>ligula</i> certainly
had more resemblance to a small spatula, or tea-spoon,
than to our forks. According to Martial, many spoons at
the other end seem to have been <i>ligulæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a>. But the two epigrams
must be read in conjunction, so that the second may
appear a continuation of the first; for the epithets <i>habilis</i> and
<i>utilis</i> can be applied to no other term than <i>ligula</i>. Besides,
it is certain that the titles of the epigrams, or at least the
greater part of them, were not added by the poet, but by
transcribers. The name also, which originally was <i>lingula</i>,
gives an idea of the form. We read likewise that this instrument
was used for scumming, for which purpose nothing
is less fit than a <span class="locked">fork<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a></span>.</p>

<p>I have, I know not how, a great unwillingness to represent
the tables of our ancestors as without forks; yet this was
certainly the case: and when we reflect on their manner of
eating, it will readily be perceived that they could much
easier dispense with the use of them than we can. All their
food, as is still customary in the East, was dressed in such a
manner as to be exceedingly tender, and therefore could be
easily pulled to pieces. It appears however that people,
though not in the earliest periods, employed the same means
as our cooks, and suffered meat to lie some time that it might
be easier dressed. We often read that cooks, in order to
provide an entertainment speedily, will kill an animal, and
having cleaned and divided it, roast it immediately, and then
serve it up to their guests. But it is well known that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
flesh of animals newly killed, if cooked before it has entirely
lost its natural warmth, is exceedingly tender and savoury, as
we are assured in many books of travels.</p>

<p>Formerly all articles of food were cut into small morsels
before they were served up; and this was the more necessary,
as the company did not sit at table, but lay on couches
turned towards it, consequently could not well use both
their hands for eating. For cutting meat, persons of rank
kept in their houses a carver, who had learned to perform
his duty according to certain rules, and who was called <i>scissor</i>,
<i>carpus</i>, <i>carptor</i>, and by Apuleius is named <i>diribitor</i><a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a>. This
person used a knife, the only one placed on the table, and
which in the houses of the opulent had an ivory handle, and
was commonly ornamented with <span class="locked">silver<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a></span>.</p>

<p>Bread also was never cut at table. In former times it was
not baked so thick as at present, but rather like cakes, and
could easily be broken; hence mention is so often made of
the breaking of bread. Juvenal, when he wishes to describe
old bread, does not say that it could not be cut, but that it
could not be <span class="locked">broken<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a></span>. The ancient form of bread is still
retained in the paschal cake of the Jews, and in the <i>knæckbröd</i><a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a>
of the Swedes. The latter, which is almost as brittle
as biscuit, is not cut when used, but broken.</p>

<p>The Chinese, who also use no forks, have however small
sticks of ivory, which are often of very fine workmanship,
and inlaid with silver and gold. A couple of these is placed
before each guest, who employs them for putting into his
mouth the meat which has been cut into small bits. But
even this resource was not known two centuries ago in
Europe, where people, as is still done by the Turks, everywhere
used their fingers. As a proof, I shall not quote passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
where mention is made of persons putting their hands
or fingers into the <span class="locked">dish<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a></span>; for such a mode of speaking is yet
employed, though forks, as is well known, are in common use.
I shall refer only to one passage in Ovid, which admits of no
<span class="locked">doubt<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a></span>, and where the author would certainly have mentioned
these instruments, or rather have communicated to his
pupils in the art of love a precept which at present is given
to children, had the former been taught when young how to
make use of forks.</p>

<p>Had they been used by the Romans, they must necessarily
have occurred among the numerous remains of antiquity
which have been collected in modern times. But Baruffaldi
and Biörnstähl<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a>, who both made researches respecting them,
assure us that they were never able to find any. Count
<span class="locked">Caylus<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a></span> and <span class="locked">Grignon<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a></span> only assert the contrary. The former
has given a figure and description of a silver two-pronged
fork, which was found among rubbish in the Appian Way.
It is of exceedingly beautiful workmanship, and at one end
terminates in a stag’s foot. Notwithstanding the high reputation
of this French author, I cannot possibly admit that
everything of which he has given figures is so old as he seems
to imagine. Grignon found in the ruins of a Roman town
in Champagne some articles which he considers as table-forks;
but he merely mentions them, without giving a description
sufficient to convince one of the truth of what he asserts,
which, in regard to a thing so unexpected, was certainly requisite.
One fork was of copper or brass; two others were
of iron; and he says, speaking of the latter, that they seem
to have served as table-forks, but were coarsely made. I
however doubt whether he conjectured right in regard to the
use of them.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the use of forks was first known in Italy
towards the end of the fifteenth century; but at that time
they were not very common. Galeotus Martius, an Italian,
resident at the court of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary,
who reigned from 1458 to 1490, relates, in a book which he
wrote in regard to the life and actions of this prince, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Hungary, at that time, forks were not used at table, as they
were in many parts of <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a></span>, but that at meals each person laid
hold of the meat with his fingers, and on that account they
were much stained with saffron, which was then put into
sauces and soup. He praises the king for eating without a
fork, yet conversing at the same time and never dirtying his
clothes.</p>

<p>That in France, at the end of the sixteenth century, forks
even at court were entirely new, is proved by a book, already
quoted in the present volume of this work, entitled l’Isle des
Hermaphrodites. It will therefore excite no wonder that in
the same century forks were not used in Sweden.</p>

<p>But it must appear very strange that Thomas Coryate, the
traveller, should see forks for the first time in Italy, and in
the same year be the first person who used them in England,
on which account he was called, by way of joke, <span class="locked">Furcifer<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
In many parts of Spain, at present, drinking-glasses, spoons
and forks are <span class="locked">rarities<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a></span>; and even yet, in taverns, in many
countries, particularly in some towns of France, knives are
not placed on the table, because it is expected that each person
should have one of his own; a custom which the French
seem to have retained from the old Gauls. But as no person
would any longer eat without forks, landlords were obliged
to furnish these, together with plates and spoons.</p>

<p>Among the Scotch highlanders, as Dr. Johnson asserts,
knives have been introduced at table only since the time of
the revolution. Before that period every man had a knife of
his own as a companion to his dirk or dagger. The men cut
the meat into small morsels for the women, who then put
them into their mouths with their fingers. The use of forks
at table was at first considered as a superfluous luxury, and
therefore they were forbidden to convents, as was the case in
regard to the congregation of St. Maur.</p>

<p>The English, Dutch and French have adopted the Italian
names <i>forca</i> and <i>forchetta</i>, given to our table-forks; though
these appellations, in my opinion, were used at an earlier
period to denote large instruments, such as pitch-forks, flesh-forks,
furnace-forks; because in the low German, <i>forke</i> is a very
old name given to such implements. The German word <i>gabel</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
which occurs first in dictionaries for these large instruments,
is of great antiquity, and has been still retained in the Swedish
and Dutch. It appears to have been used for many things
which were split or divided into two; at any rate, it is certain
that it is not derived from the Latin word <i>gabalus</i>.</p>

Italy, Switzerland, and a part of Germany. An account of this tour was
published by him, in 1611, under the singular title of Crudities, a new
edition of which appeared in 1776. He travelled afterwards to the East
Indies, and in 1615 wrote in that country some letters which may be seen
in Purchas his Pilgrims, vol. ii.; also in the second edition of the Crudities
published in 1776. In page 90 of the Crudities the author says,
“Here j will mention a thing that might have been spoken of before in
discourse of the first Italian towne. J observed a custome in all those
Italian cities and townes through the which j passed, that is not used in
any other country that j saw in my travels, neither do j thinke that any
other nation of Christendome doth use it, but only Italy. The Italian,
and also most strangers that are commorant in Italy, do alwaies at their
meales use a little forke when they cut their meat. For while with their
knife which they hold in one hand they cut the meate out of the dish,
they fasten their forke, which they hold in their other hand, upon the
same dish; so that whatsoever he be that sitting in the company of any
others at meale, should unadvisedly touch the dish of meate with his
fingers from which all at the table doe cut, he will give occasion of offence
unto the company, as having transgressed the lawes of good manners, insomuch
that for his error he shall be at least brow beaten if not reprehended
in wordes. This form of feeding j understand is generally used in all places
of Italy; their forkes being for the most part made of yron or steele, and
some of silver, but those are used only by gentlemen. The reason of this
their curiosity is, because the Italian cannot by any meanes indure to have
his dish touched with fingers, seeing all men’s fingers are not alike cleane.
Hereupon j myselfe thought good to imitate the Italian fashion by this
forked cutting of meate, not only while j was in Italy, but also in Germany,
and oftentimes in England since j came home, being once quipped
for that frequent using of my forke by a certain learned gentleman, a familiar
friend of mine, one Mr. Laurence Whitaker, who in his merry humour
doubted not to call me at table <i>furcifer</i>, only for using a forke at
feeding, but for no other cause.”</p>

<p>
[The use of forks was at first much ridiculed in England, as an effeminate
piece of finery; in one of Beaumont and Fletcher’s plays, “your
fork-carving traveller” is spoken of with much contempt; and Ben Jonson
has joined in the laugh against them in his Devil’s an Ass, Act. v.

<h2 id="lottery">LOTTERY. TONTINE.</h2>

<p>At present there are two kinds of lottery in Europe. One is
called the Italian or Genoese lotto, or merely the lotto; the
other is the common lottery well known in England. Of the
former, which has been long proved to be attended with great
deception, and must soon be universally acknowledged to be
hurtful, I do not mean here to treat, but only of the latter,
which at any rate may be honourable or harmless, if we do
not take into account the delusion it occasions to credulous
and ignorant people, by exciting hopes which have little probability
in their favour. I however do not promise a complete
history of this invention: it experienced so many changes
before it acquired its present form, that to give a full account
of them would be tiresome to me as well as to the reader.</p>

<p>I shall not either, as some have done, reckon among the
first traces of lotteries every division of property made by lot,
otherwise it might be said, that Joshua partitioned the promised
land into lottery-prizes, before it was conquered. In
my opinion the peculiarity of lotteries consists in this, that
numbers are distributed gratuitously, or, as in our public lotteries,
for a certain price, and it is then left to chance to determine
what numbers are to obtain the prizes, the value of
which is previously settled. The various conditions and
changes invented by ingenuity to entice people to purchase
shares, and to conceal and increase the gain of the undertakers,
are not here taken into consideration, because they do
not appear to be essential.</p>

<p>In the whole history of antiquity, I find nothing which has
a greater resemblance to our lotteries than the <i>congiaria</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
the Romans; and I am inclined to think that the latter furnished
the first hint for the establishment of the former. Rich
persons at Rome, as is well known, and particularly the emperors,
when they wished to gain or to strengthen the attachment
of the people, distributed among them presents, consisting
of eatables and other expensive articles, which were named
<i>congiaria</i>. In general, tokens or tickets called <i>tesseræ</i><a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> were
given out, and the possessors of these, on presenting them at
the store or magazine of the donor, received those things
which they announced. In many cases these tickets were
distributed <i>viritim</i>, that is, to every person who applied for
them; and in that case these donations had a resemblance to
our distributions of bread, but not to our lotteries, in which
chance must determine the number of those who are to participate
in the things distributed.</p>

<p>But in the course of time it became customary to call the
people together, and to throw among them, from a stage, the
articles intended for distribution, in the same manner as
money is scattered among the populace at the coronation of
the emperor, and on other solemnities. Such things, in this
case, were called <i>missilia</i>, and belonged to those who had the
good fortune to catch them. But as oil, wine, corn and other
articles of the like kind, could not be distributed by throwing
them in this manner, and as some articles were so much injured
by the too great eagerness of the people, that they could
be of little or no use, tokens or tickets were thrown out in
their stead. At first these were square pieces of wood or
metal, but sometimes also balls of wood inscribed with the
name of the article which the possessor was to receive from
the <span class="locked">magazine<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a></span>. Like bank-notes they were payable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
bearer; and those who had obtained <i>tesseræ</i> were allowed to
transfer or to sell them to others. This is proved by a passage
in <span class="locked">Juvenal<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a></span>, where allusion however is made only to
the <i>tesseræ frumentariæ</i>, which were not thrown out, but
distributed.</p>

<p>Imitations of these Roman <i>congiaria</i>, but indeed on a very
reduced scale, have been employed in modern times by princes
and princesses, in order to amuse themselves with distributing
small presents to their courtiers. For this purpose various
trinkets or toys are marked with numbers; these numbers are
written upon separate tickets, which are rolled up and put
into a small basket or basin. Each of the company then
draws one out, and receives as a present the article marked
with the same number. These small <i>congiaria</i> were formerly
called in German <i>glückstöpfe</i>, or <i>glückshäfen</i>; and in
the course of time the present lotteries took their rise from
them.</p>

<p>In Italy, where commerce, as is well known, was first
formed into a regular system, and where the principal mercantile
establishments and useful regulations were invented,
the merchants or shopkeepers, even in the middle ages, were
accustomed, in order that they might sell their wares in a
speedier manner and with more advantage, to convert their
shops into a <i>glücksbude</i>, where each person for a small sum of
money was allowed to draw a number from the <i>glückstöpfe</i>
(jar of fortune), which entitled him to the article written
upon it. At first governments gave themselves very little
trouble about this mode of selling merchandise. But as the
shopkeepers gained excessive profits, and cheated the credulous
people by setting on their wares an extravagant price,
which was concealed by the blanks, these <i>glückshäfen</i> were
forbidden, or permitted only under strict inspection, and in
the course of time on paying a certain sum to the poor, or to
the sovereign. In Germany they are still retained at many
of the annual fairs; but in most countries they are subject to
many limitations.</p>

<p>From these <i>glückshäfen</i> were produced our lotteries, when
articles of merchandise were no longer employed as prizes,
but certain sums of money, the value of which was determined
by the amount of the money received, after the expenses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
gain required by the undertakers were deducted, and when
the tickets were publicly drawn by charity-boys blindfolded.
As these lotteries could not be conducted without defrauding
the adventurers, it was at first believed, through old-fashioned
conscientiousness, that it was unlawful to take advantage of
the folly and credulity of the people, but for pious or charitable
purposes.</p>

<p>Lotteries were then established by private persons, and in
the course of time even by governments; and the clear gain
was applied to the purpose of portioning poor young women,
of redeeming slaves, of forming funds for the indigent, and to
other objects of beneficence. It was also hoped that these
public games of hazard would banish other kinds still more
dangerous; and no one suspected that the exposing of tickets
for sale, and the division of them, so that one could purchase
an eighth or even a smaller share, would maintain and diffuse
the taste of the public for gambling. This, however, increased;
and the profit of lotteries became so great, that
princes and ministers were induced to employ them as an
operation of finance, and to hold the bank which always enriched
the undertakers. People were then forbidden to
purchase tickets in foreign lotteries, that the money won from
the adventurers might pass into the sovereign’s treasury, or
at any rate be retained in the country; and in order that
tickets might be disposed of sooner and with more certainty,
many rulers were so shameless as to pay the salaries of their
servants partly in tickets, and to compel guild companies and
societies to expend in lotteries what money they had <span class="locked">saved<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a></span>.</p>

<p>Of the oldest lotteries among the Italians I have not been
able to find any account. Varchi, who wrote about the year
1537, relates that during a great scarcity of money at Florence
in 1530, a lottery was established for the benefit of the
state, and that the price of a ticket was a ducat. He however
does not employ the term lottery, but uses the words <i>un
lotto</i>, and calls a ticket <i>polizza</i>, a term which, as is well known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
is generally used in regard to insurance. Le Bret says, that
at Venice, in 1572, the inspection of lotteries was entrusted to
the <i>proveditori del commune</i>; but as he does not mention the
historian from whom this account is borrowed, the word
which he translates lottery cannot be known. We nevertheless
learn from his account, that this game was established
at Venice in the middle of the sixteenth century, and placed
under the inspection of the government.</p>

<p>It is certain that the chance game which gave rise to lotteries
was brought from Italy to France under the name of
<i>blanque</i>, a word formed from the Italian <i>bianca</i>. The greater
part of the tickets drawn were always white paper, <i>carta
bianca</i>, consequently blanks; and because that word occurred
oftenest in drawing, it gave rise to the general appellation.
Hence also is derived the phrase <i>trouver blanque</i>, to obtain
nothing, to get a blank, or to lose. At the time Pasquier
<span class="locked">wrote<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a></span>, that is, in the last half of the sixteenth century, the
name <i>numero</i> was also usual, because the numbers of the
tickets, which were then called <i>devises</i>, were announced in
the time of drawing. This name, instead of <i>nombre</i>, confirms
the Italian origin. As each person in the time of drawing
was attentive to his number, the phrase <i>entendre le numero</i>
was applied to those who knew or did not forget their numbers.
Hence the expression, as Pasquier remarks, <i>Il entend
le numero</i>, which is still said of those who know their own
interest, or understand how to pursue it. Frisch and others,
therefore, in their dictionaries have derived it improperly
from the numbers with which merchants marked their goods.</p>

<p>In France also the first <i>blanques</i> (lotteries) had no other
prizes than articles of merchandise; and on that account they
were set on foot only by merchants. But in the year 1539
Francis I. endeavoured to turn them to his own advantage by
imitating the public establishment of them usual at Venice,
Florence, and Genoa. He permitted these games of chance
under the inspection of certain members of the government,
with a view, as was pretended, of banishing deceptive and
pernicious games of chance, on condition that for every ticket,
<i>devise</i> or <i>mise</i><a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a>, a <i>teston de dix sols six deniers</i> should be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
to the king. But however small the sum required may have
been, this <i>blanque</i> was not filled up in the course of two years,
and the king was obliged to recommend it by an order issued
in the month of February 1541; yet it is not known whether
it was ever <span class="locked">completed<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the years 1572 and 1588, Louis de Gonzague, duke de
Nivernois and Rethelois, established a <i>blanque</i> at Paris, for
the purpose of giving marriage portions to poor virtuous
young women belonging to his estates. No lottery was ever
drawn with so much ceremony and parade. Before the
drawing, which began every year on Palm Sunday, mass was
said; the servants employed were obliged to swear that they
would act in a faithful and impartial manner; and even Sextus
V. gave to those who should promote this good work remission
of their sins. The prize tickets were inscribed as
follows: <i>Dieu vous a élue</i>, or <i>Dieu vous console</i>. The former
ensured to the young woman who drew it 500 francs, which
were paid to her on her wedding-day; the latter was the inscription
of blanks, but suggested the hope of being more
fortunate the year <span class="locked">following<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a></span>.</p>

<p>This example induced ladies of quality from time to time
to establish similar <i>blanques</i> (lotteries) for benevolent purposes.
Some destined the profit to the building or repairing
of certain churches and convents. Three ladies, whose names
history has not thought proper to communicate, set on foot a
lottery containing a certain number of tickets at forty sous
each, and employed the gain in redeeming, by means of the
Mathurines or Patres, as they were called, persons who had
fallen into slavery among the Turks. On one occasion a
<i>blanque</i> or lottery of a very singular nature was instituted by
some ladies, in order to raise a fund for their spiritual guide
or confessor, who had been chosen bishop, but had no property,
that they might purchase for him a carriage and horses,
with every thing necessary to support his ecclesiastical dignity.
Each of these grateful ladies was obliged to procure
or present to him the article announced by the ticket she had
drawn, “pour le remercier, par cette petite largesse, pour le
bon ordre qu’il avoit apporté à leurs consciences.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
But these games of chance occur much oftener in the
French history, as the means employed to make valuable
presents to ladies and other persons of distinction. The
largest, in all probability, is that by which Cardinal Mazarine
endeavoured to increase his splendour, and render himself
more popular among the courtiers. The tickets were distributed
as presents; each was a prize, and the prizes were
rarities of various kinds, and of different values. This, says
the historian, was perhaps the first time that fortune did good
to all and hurt to no <span class="locked">one<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a></span>.</p>

<p>That these games of chance became in the middle of the
seventeenth century lotteries, in the proper sense of the word,
is unanimously asserted by all the French historians who
have touched on this subject, though in some circumstances
they differ from each other. In the year 1644, Laurence
Tonti came from Naples to Paris, and during a scarcity of
money which then prevailed, proposed that kind of life-rents
or annuities which at present are named after him <i>Tontines</i>,
though they were used in Italy long before his time. But
after tedious disputes in regard to his proposal, which was at
length rejected, he gave in its stead a new plan for a large
<i>blanque</i>, or lottery, which in 1656 obtained the royal approbation.
It was to consist of 50,000 tickets, each at two
<i>Louis d’ors</i>, so that the whole receipt would amount to
1,100,000 livres; but it is to be recollected that a <i>Louis d’or</i>
at that time was only eleven livres. Of this sum 540,000
livres were to be deducted for building a stone bridge and an
aqueduct. The expenses of the <i>blanque</i> were estimated at
60,000 livres, and the remaining 500,000 were to be divided
into prizes, the highest of which was 30,000 livres. But this
<i>blanque royale</i>, for so it was called, was never filled up, and
consequently never drawn. On this account it was found
necessary to construct a wooden bridge in the room of that
which had been burnt. As complaints were often made by
mercantile people in regard to the disposal of merchandise in
this manner, which had been hitherto permitted, and as this
practice had evidently injured the <i>blanque royale</i>, the former
in the month of January 1658 was entirely forbidden.</p>

<p>In the year 1660, when the conclusion of peace and the
marriage of Louis XIV. were celebrated, the first lottery on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
the plan of Tonti was set on foot at Paris. It was drawn
publicly under the inspection of the police. A ticket cost
only a <i>Louis d’or</i>, and the highest prize was 100,000 livres.
This was won by the king himself; but he would not receive
it, and left it to the next lottery in which he had no <span class="locked">ticket<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a></span>.
This was soon followed by several others. On that account,
in the year 1661, all private lotteries were expressly forbidden
under severe penalties, and this prohibition was repeated in
1670, 1681, 1687, and <span class="locked">1700<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a></span>. Since that time there have
been no other lotteries but the <i>loteries royales</i>, the profits of
which were, in general, applied to public buildings, as was
the case in regard to the magnificent church of St. Sulpice,
and on that account they met with great support.</p>

<p>Sauval, and some others, ascribe the introduction of lotteries
to a person from Lyons, named De Chuyes, who by
profession was a gold-beater, but had a great knowledge of
trade. He afterwards undertook long sea voyages, and published
a book entitled, La Guide des Chemins de Paris, redigée
par ordre alphabetique. His name however does not
occur in any of the king’s patents, but that only of Tonti.</p>

<p>This De Chuyes, according to Sauval, first proposed the
name <i>lottery</i>, then usual in Italy, which however the other
persons concerned did not approve. In particular, the well-known
De Vaugelas, who had been chosen director of the
undertaking, and who thereby hoped to pay his debts,
strongly opposed it, and recommended the title <i>blanque royale</i>,
though, in consequence of the many deceptions practised
in the old games of chance known under that name, it was
not likely to become popular. This much is certain, that the
name lottery was first used in France about the year 1658;
for the order before-mentioned of 1656 has the name <i>blanque</i>,
but in that of 1658, the word lottery occurs for the first time,
and in that of 1661 we find <i>espèce de blanque et loterie</i>, and
in that of 1670, <i>loteries et blanques</i>.</p>

<p>It is certain that the name was much earlier used in Italy
and other countries, though Varchi employs only the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
<i>Lotto</i>. I am acquainted with no older mention of the name
Lottery than that in the passage quoted by Menage, from a
letter of Christopher Longolius, or, as he is called by the
French, Longueuil. It certainly seems to show that lotteries,
in the first half of the sixteenth century, were new; but I
doubt much whether it can be proved from it that the name
is of French, and not Italian extraction, as Menage thinks,
because Longolius generally gave himself out as a Frenchman,
though he was born at Mechlin in 1490. As the name
is much newer in France, and as the letter was written from
Padua, where Longolius died in 1522, it is far more probable
that the name had its origin in <span class="locked">Italy<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the last place, this letter was written a short time before
Longolius’s death; for he mentions the election of pope
Adrian, which took place the same year.</p>

<p>The name lottery has been used also by Simon Majolus,
who describes the oldest manner in which it was <span class="locked">conducted<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a></span>;
but I have not been able to find at what time this Italian
ecclesiastic wrote, though in all probability about the end
of the sixteenth century. However it is still doubtful whether
he was the author of the portion of the work referred
to; for it is known that the greater part of the Dies Caniculares,
published under his name, was written by Petrus
Draudius, who died in the year 1630.</p>

<p>The word <i>Lot</i>, in many ancient as well as modern languages,
and particularly in the English, Swedish, Danish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Dutch, has the same signification as <i>sors</i>, and is evidently the
<i>lotto</i> of the Italians, and the <i>los</i> or <i>loos</i> of the Germans; consequently
there is no proof that the word lottery is of French
extraction, as Menage has <span class="locked">supposed<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a></span>.</p>

<p>In England the first lottery was proposed in the years 1567
and 1568, and, as the historian says, held at the west door of
St. Paul’s Cathedral, and was drawn day and <span class="locked">night<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a></span>, from
the 11th of January 1569, to the 6th of May the same year.
It contained 400,000 tickets, at ten shillings each. The prizes
consisted partly in money, and partly of silver plate and other
articles. The net profit was to be employed in improving
the English harbours. The Antiquarian Society of London
have still in their possession the original scheme, as it was
then <span class="locked">printed<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a></span>; from which it appears that the name lottery
was at that time used in England. [In the year 1612 a lottery
was drawn for the benefit of the English colonies in Virginia;
permission was granted by special favour of king
James I.; the largest prize in which, being silver-plate to the
value of 4000 crowns, fell to the share of a tailor. In 1620
lotteries were suspended, in consequence of a representation
from the House of Commons that they were prejudicial to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
the morals of the nation; but one was afterwards permitted
in 1630, by a special license from king Charles I., in aid of
the expenses of a project for conveying water to London;
and <span class="locked">Anderson<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a></span> says that this is the first time that lotteries
are mentioned either in the <i>Fœdera</i> or <i>Statutes</i>.</p>

<p>In the reign of Charles II., one of the methods resorted to
by that monarch to reward the officers who had remained
faithful to his cause, was to give them grants of plate and
other valuables, with permission to dispose of them by a lottery.
This gave rise to various schemes, under the titles of
royal-oak and twelve-penny lotteries, &amp;c.; which were sanctioned
by government, as we learn by the following advertisement,
which appeared soon after the Restoration:&mdash;“This
is to give notice, that any persons who are desirous to farm
any of the counties within the kingdom of England or dominion
of Wales, in order to the setting up of a plate lottery,
or any other lottery whatsoever, may repair to the lottery-office
in Mermaid-court, over against the mews, where they
may contract with the trustees commissioned by his majesty’s
letters patent for the management of the said patent, on behalf
of the truly loyal indigent officers.”</p>

<p>In 1694, a loan of a million was raised by the sale of
tickets at £10 each, the prizes in which were funded at the
rate of 4 per cent. for sixteen years certain. In the reign of
queen Anne lotteries were forbidden as hurtful, but soon
after they were again permitted under a variety of conditions,
and were commonly for terminable annuities, to which both
blanks and prizes became entitled at different rates; thus in
1710, the lottery consisted of 150,000 tickets, valued at £10
each; every ticket being entitled to an annuity for thirty-two
years, the blanks at 14<i>s.</i> per annum, and the prizes to
various annuities, from £5 to £1000. Tickets appear to
have been first divided into shares during the administration
of Sir Robert Walpole.</p>

<p>In 1746, a loan of three millions was raised on 4 per cent.
annuities, and a lottery of 50,000 tickets at £10 each; and in
1747, one million was raised by the sale of 100,000 tickets,
the prizes in which were founded in perpetual annuities, at
the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. During the same century
government constantly availed itself of this means to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
money for various public works, of which the British Museum
and Westminster-bridge are well-known examples.</p>

<p>Probably the last occasion on which this taste for gambling
was thus made use of occurred in 1780, when every subscriber
of £1000 towards a loan of twelve millions, at 4 per
cent., received a bonus of four lottery tickets, the intrinsic
value of each of which was £10.</p>

<p>In 1778 an act was passed obliging every person who kept
a lottery-office to take out an annual license, and to pay £50
for the same, a measure which reduced the number of lottery-offices
from 400 to 51.</p>

<p>In 1823, however, the last act sanctioned by parliament
for the sale of lottery tickets, contained provisions for putting
down all state and private lotteries, and for rendering illegal
the sale, in this kingdom, of all tickets or shares of tickets in
any foreign lottery.]</p>

<p>A lottery was drawn at Amsterdam in 1549, the profit of
which was employed in building a church <span class="locked">steeple<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a></span>; and another
was drawn at Delft in 1595. I was informed by Professor
Fiorillo that there is still preserved at Amsterdam, in
the hospital for old men, <i>oude mannen huys</i>, a beautiful
painting by David Vinckenbooms, eight feet in height and
fourteen in breadth, which represents the drawing of a lottery
in the night-time. The artist is said to have been born in
the year 1578.</p>

<p>This game of chance must have been known also at an
early period in Germany; for, in the year 1521, a lottery was
established by the council at Osnaburg, and is mentioned in
a work published in 1582; but the prizes consisted only in
articles of merchandise. The citizens of Hamburg having
proposed a lottery, according to the Dutch manner, for the
purpose of building a house of correction, the magistrates
gave their approbation in the month of November 1611, and
in 1615 it was drawn. At Nuremberg the first lottery seems
to have been drawn in the year 1715. At any rate, Von
Murr, in his Description of the remarkable things in that
city, mentions an engraving with the following title: “Representation
of the <i>Lotto publico</i>, which was drawn in the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
hall of the council-house, at Nuremberg, anno 1715.” It is
certain that we are not here to understand the so-called Italian
<i>lotto</i>, but a common lottery, as the former was not introduced
into Germany till a much later period. At Berlin the first
lottery was drawn in the month of July 1740. It consisted
only of one class of prizes, as was probably the case with all
lotteries at first. It contained 20,000 tickets, each of which
cost five dollars; so that the whole income amounted to
100,000 dollars. There were 4028 prizes, the largest of
which was a house worth 24,000 dollars.</p>

<p>The ill-famed Italian or Genoese lottery was, as its name
shows, an invention of the <span class="locked">Genoese<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a></span>, and arose from the
mode in which the members of the senate were elected; for
when that republic existed in a state of freedom, the names
of the eligible candidates were thrown into a vessel called
<i>seminario</i>, or, in modern times, into a wheel of fortune; and
during the drawing of them it was customary for people to
lay bets in regard to those who might be successful. That is
to say, one chose the names of two or three <i>nobili</i>, for these
only could be elected, and ventured upon them, according to
pleasure, a piece of money; while, on the other hand, the
opposite party, or the undertaker of the bank, who had the
means of forming a pretty accurate conjecture in regard to
the names that would be drawn, doubled the stakes several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
times. Afterwards the state itself undertook the bank for
these bets, which was attended with so much advantage; and
the drawing of the names was performed with great ceremony.
The <i>venerabile</i> was exposed, and high mass was celebrated,
at which all the candidates were obliged to be present.</p>

<p>A member of the senate, named Benedetto Gentile, is said
to have first introduced this lottery, in the year 1620; and it
is added, that the name of Gentile having never been drawn,
the people took it into their heads that he and his names had
been carried away by the devil, in the same manner as
Schwartz, the inventor of gunpowder, as a punishment for
this unfortunate invention. But at length, the wheel being
taken to pieces in order to be mended, the name, which by
some accident had never been drawn, was found concealed
in it. Hence it may be easily seen how this game of chance
was formed, by introducing numbers instead of the names of
the nobility.</p>

<p>However, if I am not mistaken, it continued to be peculiar
to the Genoese till nearly the middle of the eighteenth century.
But as all travellers spoke of this <i>lotto di Genoa</i>, and
many wished to try their fortune in it, the Genoese, for their
own benefit, established in many large towns commissioners,
whose business was to dispose of tickets, and to pay the
prizes to those who had been fortunate.</p>

<p>As an immoderate spirit of gambling was thus excited at
Rome, Pope Benedict XIII., who sat on the papal throne
from 1724 to 1730, forbade the Genoese lottery, under the
pain of banishment to those who gambled in it, and to those
who received the money. As this threat however did not
remove the evil, the succeeding pope, Clement XII., who died
in 1740, followed the example of our German princes, and
caused a lottery to be established even at Rome. Since that
time, permission for the same purpose has been renewed from
year to year.</p>

<p>It was not till a much later period that the Genoese lottery
was introduced into Germany. According to the account of
J. A. Kalzabigi, who had made himself known in Italy by
many projects, and was appointed a Prussian privy-counsellor
of commerce and finance, the first was drawn at Berlin on
the 31st of August 1763. In 1769, one was established in
the principality of Anspach and Bayreuth, where it was continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
till the year 1788. In 1774, a person named Wenceslaus
Maurer came to Neufchatel, with permission from the
king, and established a <i>Lotto</i> there much against the will of
the prudent inhabitants; but some one having won a capital
prize, for which the undertakers ought to have paid 30,000
francs, after procrastinating as long as they could, under various
pretences, they at length became bankrupts, and made
their escape from the country.</p>

<p>These pernicious lotteries continued till the end of the
eighteenth century, when they were almost everywhere abolished
and forbidden. They are now permitted only in a
very few states, which are not able to give up the paltry income
derived from them. To the honour of the Hanoverian
government, no <i>Lotto</i> was ever introduced into it, though
many foreigners have offered large sums for permission to
cheat the people in this manner. Those who wish to see the
prohibitions issued against the <i>Lotto</i>, after making a great
part of the people lazy, indigent and thievish, may find them
by the help of the index in Schlötzer’s Staats-Anzeigen.</p>

<p>[The only lottery at present existing in England under the
sanction of the government is the art-union of London. The
first institution of this kind in Great Britain originated at Edinburgh
in 1836, from the models existing in Prussia, formed
under the patronage of the king and his minister Von Humboldt,
about the year 1825. The money annually subscribed
is expended in pictures, sculptures, &amp;c. It is divided by the
committee into several portions or prizes, from £10 to £400,
and on a certain day the prizes are distributed among the subscribers
in the ordinary way. The prize-holders are then allowed
to select works of art to the value of their respective prizes from
any of the five annual exhibitions of works of art in the metropolis
for the current year. A portion of the total sum subscribed
is set aside and applied to the purpose of engraving and
printing some work of art, a copy of which is given to each subscriber.
Hence, by the combination of a very large number of
persons to subscribe for this one work of art, and the avoidance
of risk, incidental expenses, and publisher’s profits, the print,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
though at least equal to what would be charged a guinea (the
amount of subscription) in the ordinary course of trade, is
supplied to the subscribers at so small a cost as to leave by
far the greater part of the subscribed sum as a fund applicable
to the purchase of prizes. Several similar associations
have been since formed on a smaller scale in other parts of
Great Britain.]</p>

<h2 id="bologna">BOLOGNA STONE.</h2>

<p>The Bologna stone, in consequence of its property of shining
in the dark, which was observed by accident, has given rise
to many laborious researches and experiments, and to writings
almost without number, which have not so much enlarged
our knowledge of light, as proved that all the hypotheses
hitherto offered by philosophers for explaining it, if not entirely
false, are at least insufficient and uncertain. The
history of this stone, therefore, though not unknown, deserves
to be here repeated, especially as many parts of it require to
be rectified.</p>

<p>As a complete description of it would be superfluous to
mineralogists, it may be sufficient to remark, that this kind
of stone is found in plates or single pieces, which in general
are more or less of a conical form, have a dirty white or
semi-transparent water-colour, and a foliaceous structure,
which is observed on its being broken, though the stone,
considered in another direction, appears to be fibrous. The
surface of single pieces is uneven. But what distinguishes
this species from the gypseous spars, to which it bears the
greatest resemblance, is its extraordinary weight; and this it
has in common with all the varieties of heavy spar, to which,
according to its component parts, it belongs.</p>

<p>This stone is found on different eminences around Bologna,
and particularly on the hill of Paderno, which is situated at
the distance of about a German mile from the city, loose, and
scattered about between gypseous stones, in a marly earth,
some of which is still seen adhering to pieces in my possession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
It is found most readily after heavy rains, particularly
in the streams which run down the sides of the hill; and it
is there collected by persons who sell it at Bologna. In the
year 1730, when Keysler was there, a pound of it could be
purchased for a <i>paolo</i><a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a>.</p>

<p>I shall take this opportunity of remarking, that the Bologna
stone, according to its external characteristics, heaviness
and hardness excepted, has a great similarity to those
gypseous spars or selenites which were first described by
<span class="locked">Lehman<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a></span>, and at the time perhaps by him alone; according
to whose account, it is mentioned also by <span class="locked">Vogel<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a></span> and by
<span class="locked">Wallerius<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a></span>, under the name of <i>Selenites globosus</i>: on the
other hand, it has not been mentioned by modern mineralogists
under any particular appellation. In the county of
Mansfeld it is found in detached masses or single pieces,
more or less conical; and, to judge from the earth purposely
left on the specimens in my possession, which were picked
up in the neighbourhood of Sangershausen, in a yellowish-red
sandy clay. The pieces, many of which are round balls,
two or three inches in diameter, and others longish rolls, have,
externally as well as internally, a grayish colour, appear
foliated on the fracture, or seem to consist of cuneiform radii,
which meet in the centre of the ball. Many are hollow in
the inside; and in this case the ends of the cunei or needles,
which have between them a granulated gypsum mixed with
a little clay, project into the cavity. Lehman says that the
leaves, when placed in a heated stove, emit a hesperus, that
is, shine; and this circumstance made Wallerius doubtful
whether this selenite did not belong to the fluor-spars; but
it is undoubtedly a sulphate of baryta. When the crude
stone is put into acids, a very faint effervescence is sometimes
observed, arising from foreign matters; but when burnt
pieces are employed, this effect is much stronger. It does
not crack or break in the fire; but if exposed only a short
time to a red heat, it becomes totally opake, whiter, and void<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
of all lustre; it is also more friable, and crumbles to dust in
water, exactly in the same manner as bastard <i>lapis specularis</i>.
The luminous appearance in a warm stove I did not observe
in the few pieces which I subjected to experiment. I was
desirous to make this remark, because the mineralogists before-mentioned
place globular selenite along with the Bologna
stone, to which however it does not belong.</p>

<p>To render it capable of shining in the dark, a piece particularly
heavy, foliaceous and pure, must be <span class="locked">selected<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a></span>. After
being made red-hot, it is pounded and reduced to a fine
powder, which, by means of a solution of gum-tragacanth, is
converted into a kind of paste, and formed into small cakes.
When these are dried, they are brought to a state of ignition
between coals, and then suffered to cool; after which they
are preserved from the air and moisture in a close vessel. If
one of these cakes be exposed a few minutes to the light, and
then carried into a dark place, it will shine like a burning
coal. It appears therefore to attract the light, or to be as it
were a light-magnet. This power of emitting light becomes
lost in the course of time; but it may be restored at first by
heating, and afterwards by exposure again to ignition. I
shall pass over the rules necessary to be observed in the numerous
experiments made with this stone, as well as the consequences
deduced from them. The former may be found
in works on chemistry, and the latter in those on natural
philosophy.</p>

<p>All the Italian writers who first describe this remarkable
phænomenon give the following account of the discovery.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century there was at
Bologna a shoemaker, who, having quitted his trade, applied
himself to chemical labours, and particularly to the art of
gold-making. I do not know whether those who have made
the very just remark, that many shoemakers go beyond their
last into the province of other arts or sciences, have mentioned
among the already numerous instances this shoemaker of
Bologna, whose name was Vincentius Casciorolus; but he
certainly deserves a niche in the temple of fame, because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
may with truth be said of him, that he kindled up a light to
the learned; whereas the shoemaker of Görlitz, Jacob Behmen,
darkened or extinguished the existing light to the learned
as well as the unlearned, so that the minds of many are still
left in obscurity.</p>

<p>In the year 1602 Casciorolus came to Scipio Begatello of
Bologna, who at that time was particularly well known by his
attachment to the art of gold-making, and showed him this
stone, under the mystical name of <i>lapis solaris</i>, which, on
account of its weight and the sulphur it contained, as well as
of its attracting the golden light of the sun, seemed to be fit
for converting the more ignoble metals into gold, the <i>sol</i> of
the alchemists. He showed it also to J. A. Maginus, the
professor of mathematics; and the latter, who in all probability
was no adept, sent both the natural and prepared stones
to princes and learned men, and perhaps contributed more
than any other person to make known this singular <span class="locked">discovery<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a></span>.</p>

<p>It however appears as if the Italian chemists concealed the
preparation of this stone, or were not all acquainted with it.
It was always said to be a secret known only to a few individuals
in Bologna. Misson, who was there in the year 1690,
asserts that Bartholomew Zanichelli was the only person at
that time in possession of it. In 1666 it was announced in
the Philosophical <span class="locked">Transactions<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a></span>, that a clergyman, who exclusively
possessed the art, had died, without communicating
it to any one. <span class="locked">Niceron<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a></span>, <span class="locked">Lemery<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a></span>, and many others say,
that Homberg, during his residence at Bologna, had again
discovered it, after many experiments; and that Lemery
learned it from him and made it publicly known.</p>

<p>This however cannot be altogether true; for in the year
1622, P. Potier, or Poterius, a French chemist, who lived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
Bologna, taught the preparation of it in his work already
quoted, as did <span class="locked">Kircher<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a></span> in 1641, and the jesuit <span class="locked">Casati<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a></span> in
1686; though the process then employed was indeed not the
best or most convenient; the proper method being first found
out, after many accurate experiments, by the German chemist
Marggraf, who showed also how similar light-magnets or
luminous stones can be prepared from most of the heavy spars
and <span class="locked">fluor-spars<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a></span>.</p>

<p>But even at present, those who prepare this stone for sale
at Bologna talk in such a manner as if the secret were known
to them alone. This was the case, in 1771, with the director
of the institute in that <span class="locked">city<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a></span>. Keysler purchased a piece, as
large as a dried fig pressed flat, for about two or three <i>paoli</i>.</p>

<p>I shall embrace this opportunity of bringing to recollection,
from De Thou’s history of his own times, a relation which
indeed contains many things incredible, and in all probability
exaggerated, yet seems to be too well confirmed to be altogether
rejected as false. If this be admitted, it may then be
conjectured that, about the year 1550, either the Bologna
stone, or what at present is called <i>phosphorus</i> and <i>pyrophorus</i>,
was known to a few individuals. In the above year, when
Henry II. king of France made his solemn entrance into the
town of Boulogne, on its restoration by the English, a stone
from India, which was not hard, which had a luminous
appearance like fire, and which could not be touched without
danger, was presented to him by a stranger. For the truth
of this account De Thou refers to the testimony of J. Pipin,
in a letter to Ant. Mizaud, who asserts that he himself saw
the stone. Morhof, who seems inclined to consider this stone
as that of the <span class="locked">philosophers<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a></span>, remarks that this passage is
found in the first Paris edition in octavo, and in the Frankfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
re-impressions, both in folio and octavo; but not in the
other editions. He quotes also the words from the letter to
Mizaud, which must be printed somewhere, but in what work
I do not know. It appears that the historian inserted it
almost without any change.</p>

<p>[We may take this opportunity of describing one or two
other pyrophori: thus Canton’s pyrophorus is prepared by
heating a mixture of three parts of sifted calcined oyster-shells
with one part of flowers of sulphur to an intense heat
for one hour; Homberg’s, by mixing equal weights of alum
and brown sugar, and stirring the mixture over the fire in an
iron ladle until quite dry; it is then put into an earthenware or
coated glass bottle and heated red-hot as long as a flame appears
at the mouth; it is then removed, carefully stopped and suffered
to cool. The black powder which it contains becomes
glowing hot when exposed for a few minutes to the air.]</p>

<p>Child-murder is so unnatural a crime, that mankind can be
brought to the commission of it only by the greatest desperation,
for which unfortunately there is too much cause. To
parents who are just able by incessant labour to procure those
things indispensably necessary to support life, the birth of
every child increases the fear of starving or of being reduced
to beggary. Those who have secured to them a scanty subsistence,
but who live amidst the torments of slavery, wish to
the new-born child, which at any rate is doomed to death, a
speedy dissolution, before it can know that it has had the
misfortune to be brought into the world, in order that they
may not bequeath to it their poverty. A young female who
has acquired by education the most delicate sense of honour
and shame, finds herself, on the birth of an illegitimate child,
exposed at once to the utmost disgrace and contempt. Her
misfortune, though viewed with an eye of pity by the compassionate,
excites the hatred of the greater part of her relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
and friends, by whom she was before loved and respected,
and who endeavoured to render her happy; and often amidst
the most poignant feelings, and an agitation bordering on
madness, she sees no other means of saving her honour than
the total concealment of her error by destroying the child:
a resolution which, notwithstanding the vigilance of the laws,
is too often attended with success. A young woman who at this
moment finds herself suddenly despised and neglected by her
admirer, who gained her affections by the most powerful of
all means, love and confidence, and obtained from her what
she can never recover, is often induced, in a fit of despair, to
vent her fury on the consequences of her seduction&mdash;the
child of her seducer.</p>

<p>These misfortunes of mankind are among the disadvantages
attending civilised society, which always render marriage
more difficult as well as burthensome, and thereby make it
impossible to gratify one of the most powerful impulses of nature.
In the savage state, parents require no more for themselves
and their children than what they can easily obtain.
The inhabitants of Terra del Fuego, who live at the greatest
distance from all culture, find shell-fish and esculent plants
sufficient to appease their hunger; never are their thoughts
disturbed by care for the maintenance of a child. The black
slaves in St. Domingo say, that “it is only the white man
who begs;” and indeed in this they are <span class="locked">right<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a></span>. Beggars
exist only where they are established by religion and governments
which command them to be fed. But the transition
from living by one’s own industry to beggary is, in consequence
of the shame attending it, most painful and insupportable to
those who with the greatest exertion and waste of strength,
amidst the privation of every comfort, are exposed with their
children to the horrors of famine. On the other hand, to
those who, in our states, are obliged to eat the bread of mendicity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
children are a blessing; because as long as they are
incapable of running alone, they increase their alms by exciting
greater compassion, and afterwards by begging in the
<span class="locked">streets<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is not therefore poverty already reduced to the state of
beggary, but the dread of being at length overwhelmed notwithstanding
every exertion to swim against the stream, that
occasions child-murder. The same is the effect of slavery,
which excludes the possibility of even hoping for a change to
a better condition. The serfs of a hard-hearted land-proprietor,
who however acted according to the established laws,
entered into a resolution to get no children, that they might
not be under the necessity of putting any of them to <span class="locked">death<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a></span>.
The sense of honour becomes stronger the more the manners
approach towards a certain degree of refinement; and it is
proved that it is this cause which, in most instances, gives
rise to child-murder. In vain have legislators endeavoured
to prevent this crime by capital punishment, more cruel than
the crime itself. But indeed it is difficult, or rather impossible,
to proportion punishment to delinquency or the just
degree of guilt.</p>

<p>It needs excite no wonder that many states where the
Christian religion was not introduced, and even the Jewish,
made no law against child-murder, though the atrocity of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
was never <span class="locked">denied<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a></span>. To render this crime less frequent, men
fell upon the way of exposing children, in the hope that they
might be found by benevolent persons, who would educate
and maintain them. Parents imagined that in this manner
less violence was offered to humanity, and they could more
easily be induced to resign their children to chance than to
become their murderers. They consoled themselves with the
possibility, proved by various examples, that the exposed
children might be saved, and be more fortunate than their
<span class="locked">parents<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a></span>. To promote this, they deposited them in places
where a great many people might be expected soon to pass,
and where the child would consequently be found before it
should perish by cold and hunger or be devoured by ravenous
animals.</p>

<p>With this view they made choice of the market-places,
temples, places where two or more highways met, wells, the
banks of rivers or the sea-shore, from which water was brought
or which were the usual places of bathing; and even, when
the children were placed in the water, means were contrived
that they should at any rate float some time without being
injured. For this purpose they were placed in small chests,
trays, or close baskets, or wrapped up in waterproof <span class="locked">bandages<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a></span>.
At Athens children were commonly exposed in that
place called <i>cynosarges</i>, which was one of the <i>gymnasia</i>. At
Rome the most usual place was that pillar called <i>columna
lactaria</i>, which stood in the market where kitchen vegetables
were <span class="locked">sold<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a></span>.</p>

<p>When the exposure of children in civilised states began to
be condemned as unlawful, it was however suffered to pass
unpunished, even under the first Christian emperors. Legislators
only endeavoured by regulations of every kind to render
it less common, and to provide for the maintenance of
children; until at last, through horror at the cruelty of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
but without thinking of the causes or attempting to remove
them, they conceived the unfortunate idea, in order to guard
against this crime, of declaring it to be murder, and punishing
it as such. It became then much safer for parents to
bury children, or to throw them into the sea, than to run the
chance of exposing themselves to the utmost shame and punishment,
when they were searched out and discovered. In
Greece, but not at Thebes in Bœotia<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a>, the exposure of children
was permitted and common, and therefore many of the
Greek historians mention the contrary as a foreign but meritorious
custom. <span class="locked">Strabo<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a></span>, on this account, praises the
Egyptians, and Ælian<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> extols the laws of the Thebans against
the killing and exposing of children. This cruel practice
was equally common at Rome. Romulus however, who was
himself a foundling, endeavoured to restrain it, and his order
was confirmed in the twelve tables; but as population, luxury,
scarcity, and dissipation increased, it became customary for
those who had more children than they wished, to expose
some of them. Many deposited with them rings and other
costly ornaments; and those who were poorer, trinkets of
little value, partly to entice people to receive the children,
and partly that, by describing these appendages, when the
children were grown up, or their own circumstances had become
better, they might be able to recover them.</p>

<p>Even at present, in many places, the children carried to
foundling hospitals are accompanied by tokens, which are
carefully preserved, as is the case in the Spedale degl’ Innocenti
at Florence, where a piece of lead imprinted with a
number is hung round the neck of each babe, in such a manner
that it cannot be easily removed, and occasions no inconvenience
in the wearing. By these means one can obtain
information there, even at a late period, in regard to each
<span class="locked">child<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a></span>.</p>

<p>It is mentioned by <span class="locked">Tacitus<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a></span>, as a circumstance deviating
from the Roman manners, that the old Germans considered
child-murder as a crime; and where he speaks of the peculiarities
of the Jews, he does not fail to relate the same thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
of <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a></span>. Dionysius of Halicarnassus bestows the like praise
on the <span class="locked">Aborigines<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a></span>.</p>

<p>When the morals of mankind began to be improved under
the influence of Christianity, its followers endeavoured by
every means in their power to banish from among them this
cruelty, on account of which they so bitterly reproached the
<span class="locked">Romans<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a></span>. The first Christian emperors, however, did not
venture to forbid it as a crime; though Constantine called
exposure a kind of murder, and wisely exerted himself to remove
the causes of it. By an order issued in the year 331,
he endeavoured to deter parents from it, as he there deprived
them of all hope of being able to claim or recover exposed
children, even if they should make good the expenses incurred
by those who had maintained <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a></span>. This cruel practice
was nevertheless continued for a long time after. <span class="locked">Lactantius<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a></span>,
who lived under the reign of Constantine, describes it
as a still prevailing remnant of barbarity; and Julius Firmicus,
who wrote about the year 336, considered it worth his
while to give particular instructions for casting the nativity
of <span class="locked">foundlings<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a></span>. The exposure of children was not completely
prohibited till the time of Valentinian, Valens and Gratian, in
the last half of the fourth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a></span>.</p>

<p>One cannot, without reluctance, believe that this barbarous
practice was so long permitted, or remained unpunished, in
civilised states; but it must be mentioned, to the honour of
antiquity, that in many countries the care of government was
directed at an early period to exposed children. Not only
were means pursued in Greece and Rome to encourage the
reception and educating of foundlings, by assigning them as
property to those who took them under their protection; but
it was also made a law, that foundlings who were not received
by private persons should be educated at the public
expense. At Thebes, where, as already observed, child-murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
and the exposure of children were forbidden, parents in
needy circumstances were desired to carry their new-born
children to the government, and the latter committed them
into the hands of those who engaged to take the best care of
them for the least money. In the like manner, at present,
foundlings are placed with nurses to be maintained at the
cheapest rate; but with this difference, that at Thebes the
children became slaves for life to those by whom they were
educated, whereas in our times, when they grow up they are
free people and learn to gain a livelihood for themselves.</p>

<p>The humane decrees of the emperor Constantine the Great,
both for Italy and Africa, the first in the year 315, and the
second in 322, deserve here to be mentioned. The governments
in those countries were enjoined to prevent the murder,
sale, giving in pawn, or the exposure of children, by
taking care that parents who were too poor to educate their
offspring, should receive from the public treasury or magazines,
or from the emperor’s privy purse, as we say at present,
food, clothing and other necessaries; and as new-born
children required immediate attention, that this should be
done without any <span class="locked">delay<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a></span>.</p>

<p>The conjecture of Gothofredus, that the emperor was induced
to adopt these measures by the urgent representation
of Lactantius, appears to me highly probable. This writer,
from the year 317, had been tutor to prince Crispus, and had
before dedicated or transmitted to the emperor his book,
wherein he painted, in glowing colours, the detestable practice
of parents then prevalent, which gave rise to the greatest
disorders; and on that account he offered them the specious
advice not to beget more children than they were able to
maintain. I am inclined to think that this advice did not
much please the emperor, who was obliged to keep on foot a
numerous army; and as it could not be very agreeable to
many married persons, he comprehended this recommendation
of prudence or moderation among those calamities from
which he was desirous to preserve parents by the above
decrees.</p>

<p>After these imperial orders, children remained with their
parents, and were educated by them; but it appears that the
cities of Athens and Rome had, at an early period, public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
orphan-houses, in which children were educated at the public
expense. What has been already said of the gymnasium
called <i>cynosarges</i> may serve as a proof; and Festus and Victor
make it still more certain that there was an institution of
this kind at the <i>columna lactaria</i>. At any rate there can be
no doubt that, in the sixth century, there were houses at
Rome for the reception of deserted children.</p>

<p>The emperor Justinian, who by a particular law, in the
year 529, declared foundlings to be free, and forbade those
by whom they were received and educated to treat them and
detain them as <span class="locked">slaves<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a></span>, often introduces these establishments,
under the appellation of <i>brephotrophium</i>, in his laws respecting
donations to churches and other beneficent <span class="locked">institutions<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a></span>.
This word, composed of the Greek term <i>brephos</i> a child, and
<i>trepho</i> to educate, seems to show that houses of this kind
were established at an earlier period in the cities of Greece,
and were only imitated at Rome; though of this I have as
yet found no proof. Du Cange and Stephen have both introduced
the word in their Greek dictionaries, but refer only
to the Justinian code. Gesner, in Stephen’s lexicon, makes
a distinction between <i>brephotrophium</i> and <i>curotrophium</i>;
the latter, it is said, means a house in which grown-up and
not new-born children are educated, and the same thing is
repeated in the same words in Calvini Lexicon Juridicum.
Both assert that this word, formed from <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κοῦρος</span> or <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κόρος</span>, <i>puer</i>,
is used by Justinian, but does not occur in the book of laws,
nor is used by Brisson. It is not to be found in the dictionary
of Basle nor in Stephen’s Greek Lexicon, but both these
have the word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">κουροτρόφος</span>, which indeed occurs in Homer
and in Hesiod. As Calvin and Gesner refer to Hottoman, I
am inclined to think that the word was coined by him, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
as Gesner in the Thesaurus of Faber says, “Curotrophium
<i>potest dici</i> domus alendis parvulis destinata.”</p>

<p>It is rather astonishing that no mention of the oldest institutions
of this kind, or of their establishment, is to be found
in the works of the ancients. There is reason however to
conjecture, that as long as the sale of children and the slavery
of foundlings were permitted, the number of those maintained
at the public expense could not be very great. But respecting
the <i>brephotrophia</i>, even under the later Christian emperors,
nothing is said to be found that can give us any idea of the
manner in which they were regulated; nothing in regard to
the place from which the nurses were procured, or how food
and clothing were provided for the children, and as little in
regard to the number of children reared in these benevolent
institutions who lived to become old.</p>

<p>It might be satisfactory to know, whether the oldest institutions
of this kind were more fortunate in answering the object
of their establishment than our expensive orphan-houses
are at present.</p>

<p>The great difficulties which attend institutions of this kind
are, no doubt, the chief cause why mention of them so seldom
occurs during the later centuries, in which the foundation of
hospitals, and donations to these and other pious establishments,
were so numerous; they are however found so often,
that it is impossible to consider them as an invention of modern
times. I shall here point out those instances which have
hitherto occurred to me; but must first observe, that many
more will be found in perusing the lives of saints, and the
history of convents, religious orders, churches and towns.
Wherever they are mentioned, they are always under the inspection
of the clergy.</p>

<p>The oldest establishment for orphans in Germany, which I
can mention at present, is that at Triers, in the eighth, or
seventh, or even sixth century; the account of it is to be
found in the life of St. Goar, who lived at Triers under
Childebert, consequently in the last half of the sixth century.
His historians or panegyrists relate that, being accused before
archbishop Rusticus of many misdemeanours, as a proof of
his innocence he hung up his hood upon one of the sun’s
rays, which entered his cell, as if upon a nail, and that his
enemies were still so incredulous as to consider him guilty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
The archbishop then, continue they, to whom a new-born
child, which had been deposited in the marble conch before
the church-door, had been brought, asked him, as a proof of
his sanctity, whether he could tell the father of it; upon
which Goar, after a most fervent prayer, commanded the
child, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, to declare
who were its parents. The child, with a clear voice,
immediately named its mother, and also its father, the archbishop
himself, who in consequence was deprived of his
<span class="locked">dignity<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a></span>.</p>

<p>The small portion of truth contained in this ridiculous
story is, that, at the time when the author wrote, there was an
establishment for foundlings at the church of Triers; that
the children were deposited in a marble conch placed before
the church; that they were received by poor people maintained
in order to watch the church, and who were called
<i>matricarii</i>, because they were matriculated in it, and by them
carried immediately to the bishop, and that the child under
his sanction was given to some person in the community who
agreed to take care of it. These foster-parents were named
<i>nutricarii</i>. It may be thence easily perceived, that there
were then no orphan-houses properly so called, in which
children are educated; but that the children, as is the case
in our institutions for the poor, were given to others to be
nursed, and in all probability the clergy paid to the <i>nutricarii</i>
a certain sum from the alms destined for that purpose.</p>

<p>One of the lives which relates to the silly tale already mentioned
was written by an author who, according to the opinion
of Mabillon, lived at a period not much later than St.
Goar. The other is by Wandelbart, who lived in the ninth
century, and who refers for his authorities to old manuscripts
and other documents, <i>vetusta et perantiqua exemplaria</i>. It
may therefore with safety be asserted, that this establishment
for foundlings existed at Triers in the eighth century. The
annalists of Triers, indeed, do not mention any bishop named
Rusticus who lived about that period; but no doubt needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
be excited on that account, as this difficulty may be solved
in more ways than <span class="locked">one<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the seventh century there were similar establishments
at Anjou, or Angers, in France. St. Magnebodus,
who was bishop of that place, where he died, and was buried
in the church called at present Saint Mainbeuf, is praised in
a very old life of him, never yet printed, for having caused
several houses for the rearing of children to be <span class="locked">erected<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the following century, that is about the year 787, an
arch-priest named Datheus, established at Milan, at his own
expense, a foundling hospital, in order to put a stop to the
crime of child-murder, which had been introduced, and of
which he gives a very affecting account in the letter of foundation.
With this view he purchased a house near the church,
and issued an order that the foundlings (<i>jactati</i>) should be
suckled in it by hired nurses, and educated for seven years.
They were to be taught some handicraft; to be supplied in
the establishment with food, clothing and shoes, and at the
age of seven to be discharged as <span class="locked">free-born<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a></span>. It deserves to
be remarked, that the mothers of children carried to such
establishments strewed salt between the swaddling-clothes,
when they wished to announce that the child had not been
baptized. This perhaps had a reference to the circumstance
of new-born children being washed in salt water; but I conjecture
that the salt thus interspersed was meant to denote
that the child had not been washed, and much less baptized.</p>

<p>In the capitulary of Charlemagne we meet with all the <i>loci
venerabiles</i> of the Justinian code: <i>xenodochium</i>, <i>ptochotrophium</i>,
<i>nosocomium</i>, <i>orphanotrophium</i><a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a>, <i>gerontocomium</i>, and
also <i>brephotrophium</i><a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a>. But at that time, at least among the
Franks, the foundlings belonged to those by whom they had
been received and educated, unless they were demanded back
by their parents or relations within ten <span class="locked">days<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a></span>. It is not improbable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
that the same practice prevailed at this time in other
countries; and perhaps the founder of the foundling hospital
at Milan, on this account, declared so expressly that the children,
when they grew up, were to be discharged from the
institution, as persons born free.</p>

<p>In the year 1168, St. Galdinus, cardinal and archbishop of
Milan, exercised great severity against heretics; but took
particular care of the poor, who believed what he taught;
namely, that the hospital there considered itself obliged, not
only to receive the sick, but also such children as might be
exposed in the city, and to provide them with food and
<span class="locked">clothing<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a></span>.</p>

<p>In 1070 Olivier de la Trau founded at Montpellier an
order, the members of which called themselves <i>hospitalarii</i>,
sive <i>spiritus</i>. They entered into an engagement to take care
of the poor as soon as possible, and to provide for the maintenance
and education of foundlings and orphans. In the course
of a little time they spread themselves into different countries;
and wherever they went, the effects of their benevolent vow
are still to be found. Some say that the institution for
foundlings, or the Hospital of the Holy Ghost, at Montpellier,
was established in the year 1180. In 1201 they settled at
Rome, and, according to the testimony of historians, formed
there an establishment of the same kind, after they had been
confirmed by Pope Innocent III., in the year 1198, and obtained
for that purpose an elegant mansion, fitted up in the
best manner. In the papal bulls mention is made of many
convents founded by this order; and I am inclined to think
that those who might take the trouble to examine thoroughly
the confused history of these hospitallers, or of this order of
the Holy Ghost, and of the still existing hospitals distinguished
by that title, would find much information in regard to this
subject. I call the history confused, because there have been
many kinds of hospitallers and similar orders, and these have
often been confounded with each <span class="locked">other<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a></span>.</p>

<p>Our neighbourhood had similar establishments at an early
period. At any rate there was one of this kind at Einbeck,
before the year 1274, that is to say, an hospital of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Ghost. It began to be built by duke Albert, who brought
Einbeck to the house of Brunswick, when it submitted to
him in 1272, in order to get rid of the importunity of count
von Dassel. Alms were collected for its establishment and
maintenance; and to promote these, the council issued recommendations,
or letters-patent, in which it was expressly
stated, that not only the indigent, and among these foreigners,
were received into their hospital, but also orphans and foundlings,
who were maintained and educated till they grew up.
Such recommendations were from time to time repeated, for
one still exists of the year 1300, which is a literal transcript
of that issued in 1274. I do not believe that the hospital at
Einbeck was established by the order before-mentioned; at
any rate, hospitals of the Holy Ghost occur chiefly in the
twelfth and two following centuries; and were founded, not
by hospitallers, but established perhaps upon their model.</p>

<p>In this manner a rich citizen of Nuremberg, Conrad Heinz,
surnamed <i>der Grosse</i>, founded the hospital of the Holy
Ghost, in 1331. It began to be built in 1333, and was completed
in 1341. Neither in the letter of foundation, however,
nor in the confirmation, are foundlings particularly named;
but it may be readily seen that this institution received poor
pregnant women, and educated the children which were either
born in it or admitted into it. In the like manner pregnant
females, both married and unmarried, and also foundlings,
are received into the hospital of St. John, at Turin. The
founder of the house at Nuremberg made it a rule, that the
day of the birth or reception of each child should be written
down, in order that the expense incurred by it might be
known, in case it should ever be able and inclined to repay
<span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a></span>.</p>

<p>The magnificent foundling hospital at Florence, called at
present <i>Spedale degl’ Innocenti</i>, was founded in 1316, by one
Pollini. There can be little doubt that this is the same establishment
for which the well-known Camaldule monk, Ambrosius,
often mentioned under his family name Traversari,
solicited support from the pope, in the beginning of the
fifteenth century. He boasts that the foundlings received by
this institution, which he calls <i>brephotrophium</i>, were first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
given to nurses to be suckled, and then admitted into the
house and instructed. Girls fit for marriage were furnished
with a portion. Citizens also were accustomed to send their
children to be educated in the school of this <span class="locked">hospital<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a></span>.</p>

<p>L’Hopital du S. Esprit, at Paris, is said to have been
founded in 1362, and various persons out of compassion for
the exposed children contributed the money necessary to its
support. A brotherhood, called la Confrairie du S. Esprit,
established to conduct the affairs of the institution, was confirmed
the same year by pope Urban V.</p>

<p>Paris, however, from time to time obtained more institutions
of this kind. In the year 1638 a widow devoted her
house to this purpose, and on that account it was called la
Maison de la Couche, a name still given to the foundling
hospital at the church of Notre Dame. But it was soon
found necessary to abandon this well-meant institution, in
consequence of the shameful abuses which had crept into it.
The nurses often sold the children to beggars, who distorted
or mutilated their limbs, in order that they might excite more
compassion, and thereby obtain greater alms. Many were
purchased also for magical purposes. The price for each
was twenty sous.</p>

<p>St. Vincent de Paule, of the congregation St. Lazare,
founded, in 1640, a new institution, which in 1670 was transferred
to the street Notre Dame. It obtained new improvements
by the chancellor Etienne d’Aligre and his lady Elizabeth
Luillier. At present this house is known under the
name l’Hopital des Enfans Trouvés, or de Notre Dame de la
Misericorde.</p>

<p>That an institution for foundlings at Venice, named before
the destruction of the republic Della Pietá, was established
in 1380, by a Franciscan named Petruccio, I have somewhere
read, but in what author I do not at present remember.</p>

<p>In England a proposal for a similar institution was made
so early as 1687; but the present foundling hospital was not
established till the year <span class="locked">1739<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a></span>. I shall not however enlarge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
further on the modern institutions of this kind: my object
was to show that they are by no means a new invention, and
that they have been continued from the oldest periods to the
present time through all ages, and even in those which we
are accustomed to call barbarous.</p>

<p>In our times most of the foundling hospitals have been suffered
to fall to decay; chiefly because, to answer the benevolent
purpose for which they are intended, they would require
to be on a larger scale and better supported than it is
possible for them to be at present; also because they do not
entirely prevent child-murder, as they are not capable of
completely removing the causes of it. After the establishment
of the foundling institution at Cassel, not a year passed
without some children being found murdered, either in that
place or its neighbourhood. To this may be added also, that
it is impossible with the utmost exertion to provide sound
nurses for the continually increasing number of children
brought in, and to ensure to them sufficient attention.</p>

<p>From the year 1763 to the end of 1781 the number of
children brought into the foundling hospital at Cassel amounted
to 740, of whom no more than eighty-eight remained alive at
the end of the latter year. More than one half of them died
under the age of eight, and scarcely ten attained to their fourteenth
year. In Paris, in the year 1790, more than 23,000,
and in 1800 about 62,000 children were brought <span class="locked">in<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a></span>. In
1790, of the children which had been brought in between
1774 and that period, 15,000 only were alive; and it is estimated
that 11/13 of all the children brought in perish annually
through hunger or neglect. Of 100 foundlings in the foundling
hospital at Vienna, 54½ died in the year 1789. In 1797,
the nurses in the foundling hospital at Metz had for fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
months received no wages, and calculation showed that 7/8ths
of the whole children perished. In an institution of this
kind, in a certain German principality, only one of the foundlings
in twenty years attained to manhood, and yet the establishment
had cost the country annually 20,000 dollars at
least. The education of no German prince ever cost so much.</p>

<p>The case with foundling hospitals is the same as with the
artificial breeding of fowls; it is easy to obtain chickens, but
for want of maternal feeding and care it is almost impossible
to rear them. Of what use then is it to collect chickens?</p>

<h2 id="orphan">ORPHAN HOUSES.</h2>

<p>As so ancient proofs are found of public attention paid to
foundlings, it may be readily supposed that in well-regulated
states care was employed at an early period to provide also
for the maintenance and education of orphans. There is reason
to believe that this was the case at Thebes, which took
under its protection the children of all poor parents. Solon
made a law, that children whose fathers had fallen in the
defence of their country should be educated at the expense
and under the inspection of <span class="locked">government<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a></span>. The same thing
was customary among the Iasei, who inhabited an island on
the western coast of <span class="locked">Caria<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a></span>.</p>

<p>At Rome children maintained at the public expense were
called <i>pueri alimentarii</i>, and <i>puellæ alimentariæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a>.</p>

<p>The emperor Trajan was the first who formed large establishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
for this purpose; and the children maintained in
them were called, from his family name, <i>pueri Ulpiani</i>.
Pliny relates in his panegyric, that he had caused five thousand
free-born children to be sought out and educated. It
is more than probable that he suffered them to remain with
their parents, and that those who were unable to educate
them themselves, received a monthly or annual allowance in
corn or money. Orphans perhaps were given out to board
at a certain fixed sum. It deserves to be remarked, that the
emperor in this manner might afford assistance, not only to
such as were depressed by poverty, but also to persons of
distinction who were not able, according as we say at present,
to support their families in a manner suitable to their
rank. To have an offspring therefore was not a misfortune,
but rather a blessing. Children were begotten in order that
the parents might take advantage of this beneficence, as some
people build houses that they may obtain the offered premium;
and the large capitals required were not taken from
the public treasury, but from the emperor’s own privy purse.
That these establishments might exist after his death, the
money in different parts destined for their support was laid
out on land, which produced a perpetual income. This is
shown by a letter of foundation for the town of <span class="locked">Veleia<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a></span>,
which is still extant.</p>

<p>In the year 1747, some peasants while ploughing in the
neighbourhood of Placentia found, together with several
other antiquities, a copper-plate five and a half feet in height
and ten and a half in breadth, which weighed 600 pounds.
They broke it in great haste, because they expected to find
under it a treasure, and sold the pieces as old copper. One
of these having fallen into the hands of the learned count
Giovanni Roncovieri, he remarked that it contained a part of
a public document belonging to the reign of Trajan. With
much trouble and at considerable expense he at length collected
all the pieces, the possessors of which, on account of
the eagerness shown to obtain them, expected for them a
high price, and thus was the means of saving one of the most
beautiful monuments of antiquity, a complete document in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
regard to the imperial establishment for the community of
<span class="locked">Valeia<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a></span>. The inscription forms six hundred and seventy
lines, and is divided into seven columns, over which stands
the following title: “Obligatio. praediorum. ob. H&mdash;S. deciens.
quadraginta. quatuor. milia. vt. ex. indulgentia. optimi
maximique. principis. imp. caes. Nervae. Trajani. Aug. Germanici.

CXX. summa. H&mdash;S. <span class="bt">LIICC.</span> quae. sit vsura 55 5 55 sortis.
supra. scriptae.”</p>

<p>Trajan therefore laid out a capital of 1,044,000 sesterces at
five per cent. interest on forty-six farms around Valeia, which
town or community was destined for this establishment.
These farms formed the mortgage, and on that account are
particularly named, together with the sum for which they
were security. The annual interest amounted to 52,200
sesterces. Of this sum 245 boys born in wedlock received
monthly sixteen sesterces each, which in a year makes 47,040;
and 34 girls of the same description twelve sesterces monthly,
making in a year 4896 sesterces. Besides these, one illegitimate
male child received yearly 144 sesterces, and one illegitimate
female child 120 sesterces. These different sums
amounted exactly to the interest of the capital laid out.</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while to reduce these sums to our present
currency. For even if we should calculate how many pounds
or shillings the silver contained in 1,044,000 sesterces would
make, this result would not give us the real value, because we
have no standard by which the relative value can be determined;
that is to say, it is not known what proportion silver
and copper bore in those periods to the prices of the necessaries
of life. The price of grain proposed by Unger as a
standard, can be employed only for later times, when corn
began to be a more general article of trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
However, Trajan’s capital, according to our money at present,
makes about 54,375 dollars, and the sum of the interest
2718 dollars; consequently a legitimate male child obtained
yearly ten dollars, and a legitimate female child between
seven and eight dollars. Such is the calculation made from
the principles laid down in Romé de l’Isle’s Metrology by
Professor Hegewisch, who has endeavoured also to compare
some pieces in the time of Trajan with those at present.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that among 300 children the emperor
admitted only two illegitimate; and Professor Hegewisch is
inclined to believe that this was the actual proportion at that
time; which indeed would induce one to form a very favourable
opinion of the state of public morals, under the reign of
Trajan, in the district above named.</p>

<p>That it was then customary to pay interest, salaries, and
pensions, not annually but monthly, is known from other
sources of information. The case was the same in regard to
the distribution of corn (<i>frumentatio</i>), as is proved by a passage
in Dionysius of <span class="locked">Halicarnassus<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a></span>, and when money was
bequeathed in perpetuity for benevolent purposes by any
person’s <span class="locked">will<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a></span>.</p>

<p>Muratori is of opinion that these pensions were paid to
boys till they arrived at the age of eighteen, and to girls till
they attained to that of fourteen; and for a proof he refers to
an order of Adrian, confirmed by the emperor Alexander
<span class="locked">Severus<a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a></span>. At the above age the males could become soldiers
and gain their pay; and girls of fourteen were fit either to be
given in marriage, or to be employed in such a way as to obtain
a livelihood by their industry. That the emperor, in
forming this establishment, had an eye to recruits for the
army, appears probable from a passage in <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a></span>; and the
example of Trajan induced rich private individuals during his
life-time, and afterwards many of his successors, to form
similar establishments for the like purpose. The same plate
was destined also to eternise the bequest of one Cornelius,
according to which 3600 sesterces, or about 187 dollars, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
the interest of 72,000 sesterces, or 3750 dollars, were to be
employed in maintaining eighteen legitimate male children,
and one legitimate female child, at the rate before-mentioned.
Pliny even, the panegyrist of Trajan, founded from his own
property pensions for the free-born children of poor parents;
a circumstance which he does not forget to mention in his
letters, and the same thing is confirmed by an inscription still
<span class="locked">extant<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a></span>. Antoninus Pius made a similar establishment for
poor girls, which after his consort were called <i>puellæ Faustinianæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a>.
The emperor Antoninus Philosophus did the same
thing; and from the name of the empress the girls were called
<i>Faustinianæ</i>, but by way of distinction <i>novæ puellæ Faustinianæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a>.
Alexander Severus formed an institution for the
education of boys and girls, whom he caused to be named
from his mother <i>mammæani</i> and <i>mammæanæ</i><a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a>.</p>

<p>In regard to the manner in which these establishments
were managed we are entirely ignorant. It is known only,
that in each of the provinces into which Italy was divided,
there was a public functionary of some rank, with the title
<i>procurator ad alimenta</i>, to whom, in all probability, the inspection
of them was entrusted. This is known to have been
an honourable office. It was held by the emperor Pertinax
when a young man, in the towns and villages on the Via
Ancilia, and in his old age at Rome <span class="locked">itself<a name="FNanchor_1104" id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a></span>. It was held also
by Didius Julianus before he became emperor, after he had
been prætor and consul, that is, enjoyed the highest offices
next to the imperial dignity, and after he had been governor
of <span class="locked">Germany<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a></span>. On ancient monuments erected to the memory
of persons of distinction, by their children, relations or friends,
it is mentioned, that, besides filling other places of honour,
they had been <i>procuratores ad alimenta</i> in certain districts
there named.</p>

<p>These are the oldest instances, with which I am at present
acquainted, of institutions for the benefit of poor children
and orphans. Orphan-houses, properly so called, in which
the children were educated together, I find mentioned for the
first time, under the name of <i>orphanotrophium</i>, in the laws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
the emperor Justinian. At later periods they occur frequently
in the decrees of the different councils, such as that of Chalcedon
in the fifth century. At the court of Byzantium the
office of inspector of orphans, <i>orphanotrophi</i>, was so honourable
and important, that it was filled by a brother of the
emperor Michael IV. (Paphlago), in the beginning of the
eleventh <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a></span>. But under the latter emperors this place
was entirely suppressed.</p>

<p>At present, orphan-houses have been abolished, since it has
been shown, by many years’ experience, that the children
cannot be educated in them healthy and at a sufficiently
cheap rate. The children are placed out to be boarded and
educated by individuals, under the inspection of those who
manage everything relating to the poor.</p>

<h2 id="infirmaries">INFIRMARIES. HOSPITALS FOR INVALIDS.<br />
FIELD LAZARETTOS.</h2>

<p>By the preceding article I am induced to give some information
in regard to the history of infirmaries. To offer anything
complete on this subject, it would be necessary to enter
also into the history of inns established for the use of pilgrims
and strangers, which in general were combined with them,
and likewise into that of the different orders instituted for
the like purpose, and of taverns which arose at a later period.</p>

<p>It is certain that ancient Rome, though a magnificent city,
had no houses into which sick persons were admitted in order
to be taken care of and cured. Diseased people, however,
were carried to the temple of Æsculapius, but for a very
different purpose. They waited there for a cure, as some
Christian believers still do in churches which contain wonder-working
images; but no preparations were made there for
their accommodation. Those numerous benevolent institutions
for the accommodation of travellers, the indigent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
the sick, which do so much honour to modern times, were
first introduced by Christianity.</p>

<p>Bodin<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a>, who could not deny this service, endeavoured to
lessen it, by asserting that, on the introduction of Christianity,
freedom was given to many slaves, who possessed nothing
else; and who, having learned no trade or handicraft by
which they could gain a living, became so burdensome to the
state, that the clergy were obliged to devise some means to
remove them from the public view, and to provide with the
necessary support these unfortunate beings, abandoned by
all mankind, whose increasing number was asserted by unbelievers
to be an effect of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>In this representation however there is some truth. It
indeed cannot be denied that our religion, as it requires humanity
and compassion, though the intolerance it occasions
converts the severest cruelties into good works, procures to
beggars more indulgence and respect than they in general
deserve, and thereby causes a continual increase of their
number. But it is to be observed that Bodin, notwithstanding
his acuteness and great learning, often suffers himself to
be led away by the effects of his innate Jewish hatred to the
Christians; and he readily embraces every opportunity of
exalting his paternal religion, the Jewish, and depreciating
the Christian, by which he obtained riches and honour.</p>

<p>The enemies of Christianity, however, during the first
years of our æra, could not but observe the numerous means
for alleviating human misfortunes which were introduced by
the new religion. It was galling to the emperor Julian to
acknowledge this superiority; and in order to banish it, he
caused his priests to provide for the poor, and to establish
for them inns (<i>Xenodochia</i>), into which they could be received;
and he assigned to them the funds necessary for that
purpose. Into these were admitted not only persons of his
own religion but of every other, in imitation of the Christians,
who, besides supporting their own poor, maintained those of
the pagans also. How much he interested himself to weaken
this means, by which the impious Galilæans procured respect,
love, and attachment, may be seen by an oration wherein he
inculcated the Christian morality as his <span class="locked">own<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a></span>. This imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
of the new religion, which contributed more perhaps to
recommend it than to bring it into discredit, is ridiculed by
Gregory Nazianzenus in his third oration.</p>

<p>The care of providing the necessary assistance to those
sick persons who can expect no help and attention from individuals,
belongs to the police; and because this forms a
part of government, rulers and sovereigns ought at all times
to have made the establishments requisite for that purpose.
But in the oldest periods, as appears, they had too much to
do in administering justice, and securing the state against
hostile attacks, to be able to attend to the necessary police
establishments.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the clergy, whose first duty was to
maintain good order, discipline, and virtue, however much
they might often in private offend against them themselves,
endeavoured to supply this want; and, on that account,
among the decrees of various councils, we find a great many
regulations which have not yet been sufficiently employed to
illustrate the history of police. The establishment of the
first houses for the reception of the sick is among the services
rendered by the clergy; and to mention all the places
of this kind, either founded by them or at their instigation,
would form a very long list. The first, or at least one of the
first houses for the reception of indigent sick was that built
at Rome by Fabiola, a Roman lady, the friend of St. Jerome,
consequently in the fifth <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1109" id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a></span>.</p>

<p>When pilgrimages to holy places, as they were called, and
often from very distant countries, came to be considered as a
part of religion, the number of these houses was much increased.
Taverns, in which pilgrims could procure proper
care and attention for payment, were not then to be found;
and most people travelled without money, in the full confidence
of meeting with gratuitous assistance. When the
clergy wished to maintain and increase the number of pilgrims,
which their own advantage induced them to do, it was
necessary that they should afford them every facility of travelling,
and consequently provide for the wants of indigent
pilgrims; and it was impossible that among these there should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
not be some sick, especially as the inconvenience, fatigue, and
dangers of the journey were much increased by many things
injurious to the health.</p>

<p>But as the principal and most dangerous pilgrimages were
made to Palestine, which is situated beyond the boundaries
of Europe, where no countrymen, and not even Christians,
one of whose religious duties it is to be compassionate, could
be expected, institutions for the reception of sound as well as
of sick pilgrims were erected by the clergy at a very early
period on the road thither, and also at the holy places. Thus
Jerome built an hospital at Bethlem; and his friend Paula
caused several to be erected on the road to that village, in
order that the devout idlers, as she says, might fare better
than the mother of God, who, on her necessary journey thither,
could find no <span class="locked">inn<a name="FNanchor_1110" id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a></span>. In the like manner, the Scots and
Irish erected hospitals in France for the use of their countrymen,
who, on their pilgrimage to Rome, might be desirous of
passing through that <span class="locked">kingdom<a name="FNanchor_1111" id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a></span>.</p>

<p>But hospitals were most necessary in wild and desert parts,
where human habitations were not to be expected; and particularly
in woody mountainous districts, and on the banks
of broad rivers, where travellers were stopped for the want of
bridges, and collected together in great numbers. It is probable
that many of these hospitals may have given rise to the
villages which are still found in such situations.</p>

<p>Pope Adrian I. recommended to the notice of <span class="locked">Charlemagne<a name="FNanchor_1112" id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a></span>
the hospitals built in the Alps; and in the year 855, the emperor
Louis II. caused those situated on mountains to be
visited and <span class="locked">repaired<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a></span>. The ruins of many of these edifices
still exist.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eleventh century, brotherhoods,
which undertook to provide for the wants of sick pilgrims,
were formed in the Holy Land; and these became richer and
more numerous as the crusades increased. It was not uncommon
for opulent persons, when dying, to bequeathe their
property to establishments in which they had found consolation
and relief; and very often those who had experienced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
cure gave their money and effects, or a considerable part of
them, to some brotherhood, either in consequence of a vow,
or in order to show their gratitude. On this account the hospitals
in Palestine could be constructed on a larger scale,
and provided with better accommodations, than any before
seen in Europe. They were therefore considered as models;
and princes and rich persons, on returning safe from their
pilgrimages, caused similar ones to be established in their
own countries. Many princes even brought with them to
Europe members of these brotherhoods, which in the course
of time were converted into orders of knighthood, that they
might employ them in the erection of hospitals. Instances
of this circumstance have been given by Möhsen, in his
History of the Sciences in the Mark of Brandenburg, and
these might be easily increased. In the same author may be
seen an account of the establishment of houses for the reception
of persons afflicted with cutaneous disorders, and of their
conversion into pest-houses. I shall here only remark, that
these inns and hospitals contributed, in no small degree, to
facilitate the travelling of mercantile people, who in the infancy
of trade, when the roads were insecure and no means
of conveyance established, were obliged to accompany their
merchandise themselves.</p>

<p>The assertion of Muratori, however, that the oldest hospitals
were not properly established for sick travellers, but
rather for the sound, is undoubtedly true; and it appears
that hospitals, according to the meaning of the word at present,
that is, such as were destined for the sick alone, were
not introduced before the eleventh century. The above
author <span class="locked">quotes<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a></span> from the life of St. Lanfranc, who was archbishop
of Canterbury in the year 1070, that he caused an
hospital to be built there, and fitted up in such a manner,
that one part of it was destined for sick men, and the other
for sick women. It is probable, or rather almost certain,
that this prelate formed the institution here mentioned after
the model of those which he had seen in his native country,
Italy. After this period similar establishments for the sick
are mentioned in various other parts.</p>

<p>The first hospitals, at least in general, were built close to
cathedrals or monasteries; and the bishops themselves had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
the inspection of them; but afterwards, either for the greater
convenience or the want of leisure, when their occupations
increased, they committed this charge to the deacons. In
the course of time, when houses for the sick were erected by
laymen, and entirely separate from monasteries, the bishops
asserted their right, often confirmed to them by imperial as
well as pontifical laws, of visiting these institutions. We find,
however, that in later times they were deprived of this privilege
by princes and sovereigns, either because they wished
to omit no opportunity of lessening the power of the clergy,
or because the latter had given reason to suspect that the incomes
destined for the use of the hospitals were not always
applied to the intended purpose. Instances are found also,
where, by the letters of foundation, the whole management
is consigned to the sovereign or the heirs of the founder.
These institutions, however, have the appearance of ecclesiastical
establishments, and still retain in many cases similar
privileges. As such they are free from all taxes, are spared
as much as possible in war, and enjoy the same rank as
churches.</p>

<p>Of the internal œconomy of the oldest houses for the reception
of the sick, no information, however, is to be found.
It is not even known whether physicians and surgeons belonged
to them, nor in what manner they were supplied with
medicines. Apothecary shops were not then established; and
those found in hospitals at present, are but of modern existence.</p>

<p>In the hospitals at Jerusalem the knights and brothers
attended the sick themselves, bound up their wounds, and, in
imitation of the Grecian heroes, Hercules, Achilles and others,
acted as their physicians. Thus we find in Amadis, and other
books of knight-errantry written in the middle ages, how much
the knights exerted themselves to obtain the best balsamic
mixtures, and that, in general, they dressed each other’s
wounds. The well-known <i>baume de commendeur</i> is one of
the oldest compositions of this kind, belonging to the times
of knighthood.</p>

<p>Profound or extensive knowledge of medicine could not
be expected among these knights, were we even unacquainted
with the account given of their skill by Guy de Chauliac.
This author, who wrote his book on the healing of wounds
in the year 1363, mentions the different medical sects, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
among these names the German knights as the fourth sect,
who, he says, cured wounds by exorcism, beverages, oil, wool,
and cabbage-leaves, and trusted to the belief that God had conferred
a supernatural power upon words, plants, and <span class="locked">stones<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a></span>.</p>

<p>The oldest mention of physicians and surgeons, established
in houses for the sick belonging to the order of Templars, is
under the government of John de Lastic, who, in 1437, undertook
the office of grand-master, and defined very exactly
the duty of physician and <span class="locked">surgeon<a name="FNanchor_1116" id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a></span>. It however appears to
me, as it does to Möhsen, that the hospitals had regular and
learned physicians at a period much earlier.</p>

<p>But, as long as this was not the case, they could afford no
instruction to young physicians in the theory or practice of
their art, like our hospitals at present. We, however, find a
very singular account in regard to Persia, where it is said
that some Nestorian priests had an hospital adjacent to their
monastery, together with an institute or school for young
physicians, who under certain prescribed rules were allowed
to visit the sick. This establishment was in a town called
Gandisapora, or, as Professor Sprengel writes it, Dschandisabor,
the medical school of which is not unfrequently mentioned
after the seventh century. The pupils who were desirous of
attending the hospital for their improvement, were first obliged
to submit to a trial, and to read the psalms of David and the
New Testament. Many of those who had here studied medicine
attained to high ecclesiastical dignity, which is the
more surprising as the rest of the Nestorian schools in the
East pay attention only to theology, and prohibit the young
clergy entirely from studying <span class="locked">medicine<a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a></span>.</p>

<p>Mad-houses, or houses for the reception and cure of insane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
persons, seem also to have been first established in the East.
Zimmerman, in his work on Solitude, says that as early as the
year 491 there was a house of this kind at Jerusalem, the
chief object of which was to take care of such monks as
became insane in the monasteries, or such hermits as were
visited by the same affliction in the deserts; but, as usual, he
has given no proofs. In the twelfth century, when the Jew,
Benjamin of Tudela, was in Bagdad, he found many hospitals
having nearly sixty shops or dispensaries belonging to them,
which distributed, at the public expense, the necessary medicines.
A large building called <i>Dal almeraphtan</i>, that is, the
House of Grace, was destined for the reception of those who
lost their reason in summer. They were kept there in chains
till they were cured; and every month this house was visited
by magistrates, who examined the state of the patients and
suffered those who had recovered their reason to return to
their relations or friends.</p>

<p>To those police establishments which form the subject of
this article belong also hospitals for invalids. Though it may
be true, that among many ancient nations the soldiers, as
sailors in some privateers at present, served voluntarily and
without pay, in the hope of acquiring by plunder a sufficient
compensation for the expenses, labour, and dangers to which
they were exposed in war, it was at any rate considered as
a general duty to make such provision for the indigent, and
also for those become incapable of military service, when they
had no means of support, that they might not be a burthen
on the public. If any one should be so devoid of feeling as
to suppose that our soldiers, after enjoying years of peace
without much waste of their bodily powers or laborious occupation,
free from care, amidst every necessary of life, and the
enjoyment of rank above those members of the state from
which they were taken, ought to consider it no hardship to
perform military service when war renders it necessary; it
still remains a duty incumbent on the government to provide
for soldiers incapable of further service, who are destitute of
support; and besides, political prudence requires it, in order
that others may not be deterred from defending their native
country or sovereign, but rather by the confident hope of a
future provision may have their courage and fidelity strengthened;
which, notwithstanding the strictest subordination, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
though fire-arms require less personal bravery than bows and
arrows, is still indispensably necessary. This truth seems to
have been fully acknowledged in the oldest periods.</p>

<p>Solon deducted something from the pay of soldiers, and
employed it for the education of children whose fathers had
fallen in battle, in order that others might be encouraged to
<span class="locked">bravery<a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a></span>. Pisistratus, following this example, made an order
that those who had lost any of their limbs in war should be
maintained at the public expense. The pensions granted do
not seem at all times to have been equally great, and they appear
to have been even modified according to <span class="locked">circumstances<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a></span>.</p>

<p>Of the attention paid by the Romans to the care of their
invalids, <i>milites causarii</i>, or soldiers become unfit for service,
either by wounds or old-age, many instances may be found,
some of which occur in the Justinian and several in the Theodosian
<span class="locked">code<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a></span>. They were not only exempted from taxes,
but frequently obtained lands and cattle as well as money,
and were assigned over, to be taken care of by rich families
and <span class="locked">communities<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a></span>. The assertion, however, that the Romans
had particular houses for invalids, in which soldiers worn
out by the fatigues of war were taken care of, and that the
<i>taberna meritoria</i> was a house of this kind, is one of the many
errors of Peter von Andlo, canon of Colmer, who is entitled
to the merit of having written in the fifteenth century, and
with a great deal of freedom, the first work on the German
public <span class="locked">law<a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a></span>.</p>

<p>How such an idea could be conceived by this author I do
not know, for the following is the only account of the <i>taberna
meritoria</i> to be found among the ancients. In the first place
we are told by Valerius <span class="locked">Maximus<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a></span>, that a traveller was murdered
in one of them in which he lodged. Judging from this
circumstance, the <i>taberna meritoria</i> appears to have been a
public tavern or inn, a meaning which writers on jurisprudence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
seem always to have <span class="locked">adopted<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a></span>. In the next place Eusebius,
who died in the year 340, relates in his <span class="locked">Chronicon<a name="FNanchor_1125" id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a></span>,
that under the second or third year of the reign of Augustus,
an oil issued from the earth in a <i>taberna meritoria</i>, on the
other side of the Tiber, and continued flowing without interruption
the whole day; but I cannot see what relation this
phenomenon can have to Jesus Christ. In the third place,
the same thing is related by <span class="locked">Orosius<a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a></span>, who lived about the
year 416; but he makes the time of this event much later,
that is to say, in the year 730 or 731 after the building of the
city, which would be about twenty years before the birth of
Christ. Nevertheless, Martinus Polonus said, in the thirteenth
century, that this oil appeared at the birth of <span class="locked">Christ<a name="FNanchor_1127" id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a></span>. Damasus
(Pope Formosus? in the ninth century) added that,
on this account, Pope Callistus I., so early as the third century,
caused a Christian church to be built in that place; and
some modern writers believe, contrary to the assertion of
<span class="locked">Platina<a name="FNanchor_1128" id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a></span>, that it is the present church of St. Mary Transtiberina,
<i>Maria in Trastevere</i>; and in this church a stone is
still shown with the inscription <i>fons olei</i>. To render the
building of a church in the third century probable, some moderns
have conjectured that this <i>taberna</i> was the cook’s shop
purchased by the Christians under the reign of Alexander
Severus, who assigned it to them with the observation that
“it was better that God should be served in any manner in
that place, than that tavern-keepers, cooks, or perhaps the
ministers of voluptuousness, <i>popinarii</i>, should there carry on
their <span class="locked">occupations<a name="FNanchor_1129" id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a></span>.” Our writers on historical criticism positively
deny that Callistus I. built a church at <span class="locked">Rome<a name="FNanchor_1130" id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a></span>. It is
to be observed also, that Donatus, who died in 1640, confidently
asserts that the <i>taberna meritoria</i> was the house where
the people of Ravenna lodged when they came to Rome to
see the public spectacles; but he does not tell us whence he
derived this <span class="locked">information<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a></span>. What I have here collected in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
to the <i>taberna meritoria</i> may serve to correct a false and
often repeated relation; but all I can prove from it is, that
this <i>taberna</i> was not an hospital for invalids.</p>

<p>Hardouin also was of opinion that there were hospitals for
invalids at Rome, one of which was built by Metellus, the
son-in-law of Pompey; but for proof he refers only to a coin
with the image of Metellus, on the reverse of which is the
naked figure of a man walking, who holds in his right-hand
the palladium, and bears on his left shoulder a naked man,
with the inscription on the face, “Q. Metellus Pius.” From
this Hardouin infers that Metellus built an Hôtel des Invalides
for sick or wounded soldiers, which he dedicated to
Pallas, and that on this account he obtained the surname of
<i>Pius</i><a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a>. It is indeed remarkable, that two coins having the
same reverse, and the inscription <i>pietas</i>, occur in Patin. I
shall leave to the judgement of the critics this opinion of Hardouin;
but I must confess that the explanation of ambiguous
figures on coins, has a resemblance to the far-fetched derivations
of etymologists. Both may be learned, ingenious, and
probable; but they cannot be employed alone as evidence,
except to add more force to a truth already proved. These
coins, perhaps, allude to some other attention paid to wounded
soldiers, of which Metellus, Herennius, and Cæsar may have
given examples; and the people are always weak enough to
set too high a value on every mark of compassion or benevolence
exhibited by their sovereigns or commanders, because
it is seldom that they observe as they ought the general duties
incumbent upon them.</p>

<p>I do not consider it a reproach to the Romans, notwithstanding
their propensity to war and robbery, that they had
no hospitals for invalids; because the remark already made
in regard to orphan-houses is applicable also to them. Magnificent
buildings, fitted up at great expense, afford a proof
of the wealth and perhaps the liberality of the founder; but
there can be no doubt that, with the capital employed, a
greater number of invalids might be maintained, and in a manner
much more beneficial to the public; that is to say, by
making such arrangements that the invalids could be distributed
throughout the country, and placed out at board and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
lodging for a certain sum. In this case many families would
be glad to receive them, both on account of the money, and
because these invalids could be of great assistance to them in
their domestic œconomy, either by labouring themselves or
overlooking others. People may praise large and expensive
hospitals as much as they please; but the sight of so many
men who have lost their health or limbs in war is but a melancholy
spectacle, and gives too great occasion to reflect how
much mankind suffer from the avarice, pride, and revenge of
sovereigns, without which wars would be less frequent.</p>

<p>The first establishment for the reception of invalids which,
as far as I know at present, occurs in history, was that formed
at Constantinople by the emperor Alexius Comnenus, at the
end of the eleventh century. A complete description of it
may be found in the history of that prince, written by his
learned daughter Anna Comnena, who says that the emperor
caused a great number of buildings standing around a church
to be fitted up as an hospital, which undoubtedly was never
exceeded in size; though other historians relate that Alexius
only revived and enlarged in an uncommon degree an old
institution. It was indeed called the Orphan-house; but sick
and indigent persons of both sexes and of every age, and, as
the female historian expressly says, soldiers dismissed from
service, were admitted into it, and provided with bed, board,
and <span class="locked">clothing<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a></span>. Though the emperor secured to this institution
several sources of revenue, it however appears not to
have long existed; at any rate, in the time of George Codinus,
that is, in the fifteenth century, the high office of
director or manager had long been disused.</p>

<p>Of the hospitals for invalids existing at present, the oldest
and largest is the Hôtel des Invalides at Paris. The kings
of France enjoyed from the earliest times what was called
<i>droit d’oblat</i>, which consisted in the power of sending to abbeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
and monasteries, in order to be maintained, officers and
soldiers unfit for further service, and particularly such as had
been wounded. Traces of this practice are said to occur
under the reign of Charles the Great; at least Seissel, in the
Life of Louis XII., relates that there was an old tradition in
an abbey in Languedoc, that the abbot had been punished
by that prince, because he would not receive the soldiers
assigned to him. It may be readily conceived how unpleasant
these guests must have been to the clergy, and how
little the ideas, mode of living, and manners of these two
classes would accord with each other. The complaints on
this subject had become so great under Henry IV., that he at
length resolved to cause all invalids to be lodged and maintained
together in a palace called “La Maison Royale de la
Charité Chretienne.” But as the revenues destined for the
support of this establishment were not sufficient, it was abolished
under the same sovereign, and the invalids were again
distributed among the abbeys and convents. In the course
of time these houses purchased exemption from this burthen,
by giving an annual pension to their guests; but they soon
spent their money, and then fell into a state of the greatest
poverty. On this account Louis XIII. renewed the experiment
of founding an hospital for invalids, which through the
want of money was never completed. At length Louis XIV.,
in the year 1670, began to build the Hôtel des Invalides,
the extravagant magnificence of which is rather a proof and
monument of the profusion and pride of that sovereign, than
of his care for meritorious soldiers.</p>

<p>In the year 1682, the hospital for soldiers at Chelsea was
founded in England by Charles <span class="locked">II.<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a></span>, carried on by James II.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
and completed by William III. But far larger and more
magnificent is the hospital for seamen at Greenwich, which
was first suggested by Queen Mary, the consort of King
William. The building, determined on in the year 1694,
was begun in 1695, and from time to time enlarged and <span class="locked">beautified<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a></span>.
As France was the first country in Europe that
maintained a standing army of national troops, it had therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
first occasion to make provision for its native soldiers
when disabled by service. As long as military men consisted
chiefly of foreigners, who served during a certain period
for pay and plunder, sovereigns believed that when a war
was ended, they were no further indebted to these aliens; they
consequently suffered them to retire wherever they thought
proper, and gave themselves no further trouble respecting them.</p>

<p>In the last place, I shall here consider the question, Since
what time have regular surgeons been appointed to armies?
and lay before the reader the little I have been able to collect
towards answering it. In the Trojan war they were indeed
not known. At that period many of the principal heroes had
acquired some knowledge of surgery, and, like the knights in
the time of the crusades, undertook the office of assisting
and curing the <span class="locked">wounded<a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a></span>. Such persons in armies were
particularly honoured, and considered to be of great value,
as appears from what Idomeneus, speaking of Machaon, says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Ιητρὸς γὰρ ἀνὴρ πολλῶν ἀντάξιος ἂλλον.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Medicus vir multis æquiparandus <span class="locked">aliis<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a></span>.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Yet the instance of Machaon shows how little care was then
taken of the wounded; for Virgil makes him even, whose
assistance must every moment have been necessary, mount
into the wooden horse, and he was the first who came out of
<span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a></span>. There is reason to think that the armies in Homer, and
until the introduction of Christianity, and the invention of
gunpowder, had in every battle but few wounded, and always
a much greater proportion of killed than in modern times.
Hostile bands stood nearer to each other; all came to close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
action; prisoners were not exchanged, but made slaves, and
among the Romans sold to the infamous schools for gladiators.
Wounded prisoners were a burthen to the victorious
party; such as could not escape defended themselves to the
last, and were put to death by the conquerors.</p>

<p>In Achilles <span class="locked">Tatius<a name="FNanchor_1139" id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a></span>, who seems to have lived in the third
century of the Christian æra, I find that an army-physician,
<i>exercitus medicus</i>, was called in to a sick person; and one
might almost believe that a regular physician appointed to
attend an army is here meant, especially as Salmasius, on this
passage, says that each cohort had in general a physician,
and therefore the appellations <i>medicus cohortis</i>, <i>medicus legionis</i>,
were found in ancient inscriptions. I will not venture
to contradict so great an authority on a subject of this kind;
but I am sorry that I have not been able to find any other
evidence of such army-physicians.</p>

<p>The first traces of field-hospitals, or, as they are commonly
called at present, flying-hospitals, occur perhaps in the East.
At any rate, the emperor Mauricius, in the sixth century,
had along with his armies <i>deputati</i>, whose duty he describes,
as did also the emperor Leo VI. in the ninth century, who
has copied many things verbatim from the work of that
prince. These <i>deputati</i> were distributed in the armies among
the cavalry, and were obliged to carry off those wounded in
battle. On this account they had on the left side of the
saddle two stirrups, in order that they might more easily take
up the wounded behind them; and for every person thus
saved, they obtained a certain reward. They were obliged
also to carry with them a bottle containing water, for the purpose
of reviving those who might have fainted through the loss
of blood. Leo, besides the officers necessary for each band
or company of a regiment, mentions expressly not only the
<i>deputati</i>, but also physicians and attendants on the <span class="locked">sick<a name="FNanchor_1140" id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a></span>.</p>

<p>Though an order was made by the Convention of <span class="locked">Ratisbon<a name="FNanchor_1141" id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
in 742, that every commander of an army should have
along with him two bishops, with priests and chaplains, and
that every colonel should be attended by a confessor, no
mention is to be found either of field-hospitals or army-surgeons
belonging to the first Christian armies in the writings
of the middle ages. We read, however, in the works of Paracelsus,
Thurneyser, Lottich and others, that they were present
at battles and sieges; but it can be proved that they
were not appointed as army-surgeons, but served merely as
soldiers.</p>

<p>The field-surgeons, who occur as accompanying armies in
the beginning of the fifteenth century, were destined rather
for the use of the commanders and principal officers, than for
the service of the field-hospital. Their number was too small
for a whole army; and as they were authorised by their commission
to receive prisoners and booty, and, like the knights,
were obliged to bring with them archers, it is highly probable
that to fight was a part of their duty also.</p>

<p>When Henry V. of England carried on war with France in
1415, he took into his service Nicholas Colnet, as field-surgeon,
for a <span class="locked">year<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a></span>. He was bound to carry with him three
archers on horseback, and to accompany the king wherever
he went. In return he was to receive yearly forty marks or
pounds, to be paid at the rate of ten marks every quarter. He
was allowed also twelve pennies per day as subsistence money,
and each of his archers had twenty marks a year, and six
pennies daily for subsistence. The chief army-surgeon, Morstede,
was engaged with fifteen men, three of whom were to
be archers, and the remaining twelve surgeons. He received
also ten pounds quarterly as pay, and twelve pennies daily
for subsistence. His archers and surgeons were placed on
an equal footing; each was to receive quarterly five pounds,
and six pennies daily as subsistence. Both Colnet and Morstede
could receive prisoners and plunder; but when the latter
amounted to more than twenty pounds in value, a third
part of it was to be given to the king. Both these head-men
had a quarter’s pay in advance; and, that they might always
have security for the next quarter, the king engaged to put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
their hands, by way of pledge, as many jewels or other articles
as might be equivalent to one quarter’s pay and subsistence.</p>

<p>Harte, in his Life of Gustavus Adolphus, seems to believe
that this prince first appointed four surgeons to each regiment,
which he reduced from the number of two or three
thousand, first to 1200, and afterwards to 1008; and he is of
opinion that it may with certainty be believed that the imperial
troops at that time had no surgeons, because Tilly himself,
after the battle at Leipsic, was obliged to cause his
wounds to be dressed by a surgeon established at Halle. He
adds in a note, that he was told that the Austrians, till about
the year 1718, had no regimental surgeons regularly appointed.
However this may be, it is certain that the field-hospital
establishments of the imperial army, till the beginning
of the eighteenth century, were on a very bad footing.
Even in the year 1718, they had no field-surgeons; but at
this period the company surgeons were dismissed, and a regimental
surgeon, with six assistants, was appointed to each
regiment; and beside the field medicine-chest, surgical instruments
were provided at the emperor’s <span class="locked">expense<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a></span>.</p>

<p>The establishment of field-hospitals in Germany is certainly
much older; for Fronsperger, who wrote in the middle of the
sixteenth century, does not speak of field-surgeons, army-surgeons
and their servants, as if they had been then newly
introduced; but in such a manner as shows that the need of
them had been generally acknowledged long before that <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a></span>.
According to his statement, it was necessary that
there should be along with the commander-in-chief, or, according
to the modern phrase, the general staff, a field-surgeon-in-chief,
a doctor who had the inspection of the field-surgeons,
the barbers and their servants, whose duty was to
drag the wounded from the heaps of slain and to convey
them to the former. He was obliged to keep by him instruments
and medicines, and at each mustering to examine the
instruments and apparatus of the field-surgeons; he decided
also, in disputed cases, how much soldiers whose wounds had
been cured ought to pay to the field-surgeon. During
marches he was bound to remain with the commander-in-chief.
Fronsperger says also, that there ought to be with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
artillery a field-surgeon of <i>arckelley</i>, and with each company
a particular field-surgeon, not however a paltry beard-scraper
(<i>bart-scherer</i>), but a regularly instructed, experienced and well-practised
man. This person was bound always to accompany,
with able servants, the ensign, and he received double pay.</p>

<p>[To give a description of all the hospitals, infirmaries and
dispensaries in this country would fill volumes. It may be
sufficient here to observe, that there are ten large hospitals in
the metropolis, each of which receives a considerable number
of patients into the house, and a still larger number of out-door
patients are prescribed for and supplied with medicines,
but attend at the establishments. In the largest of these,
which is that of St. Bartholomew, the annual number of patients,
both in-door and out, is about 12,000; about three-fifths
of these are out-door patients. The number of beds in
the hospital amounts to upwards of 550.</p>

<p>There are twenty-eight dispensaries; such patients as are
able, attend at these establishments; those who are incapable,
are visited and relieved at their own homes.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are in the metropolis ten midwifery establishments,
three ophthalmic institutions, three public lunatic
asylums, a venereal hospital, a small-pox and a fever hospital,
as also one for patients suffering from consumption.</p>

<p>There are also ninety-seven county hospitals, infirmaries
and <span class="locked">dispensaries<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
Admission to the hospitals is gained by the presentation of
a petition signed by a governor, on a certain day in each
week; of course, out of the number of patients who apply,
the worst cases have the preference. Accidents and very
severe cases are admitted at any time, and without any petition
or recommendation. The out-patients require no recommendation.
The same general rule gains attendance at
the other medical establishments.]</p>

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1134" id="Footnote_1134" href="#FNanchor_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> [There is a tradition that this institution owes its rise to the patriotic
exertions of Nell Gwynn, the celebrated mistress of Charles II. A paragraph
in a newspaper of the day seems to give some little strength to the
supposition that her family once dwelt in the vicinity; and a public-house
still exists at no great distance from the hospital, having her portrait for
its sign, with an inscription ascribing to her the merit of the foundation.
The anonymous author also of the life of Eleanor Gwynn states, that it
was at her instigation that this noble charity was established. “Another
act of generosity,” he says, “which raised the character of this lady above
every other courtezan of these or any other times, was her solicitude to
effect the institution of Chelsea Hospital. One day, when she was rolling
about town in her coach, a poor man came to the coach-door soliciting
charity, who told her a story, whether true or false is immaterial, of his
having been wounded in the civil wars in defence of the royal cause. This
circumstance greatly affected the benevolent heart of Eleanor; she considered
that (besides the hardships of their being exposed to beggary by
wounds received in defence of their country) it seemed to be the most
monstrous ingratitude in the government to suffer those to perish who
had stood up in their defence.
</p>
<p>
“Warm with these reflections and the overflow of pity, she hurried to
the king, and represented the misery in which she had found an old servant;
entreated that he might suffer some scheme to be proposed to him
towards supporting those unfortunate sons of valour, whose old age,
wounds, or infirmities, rendered them unfit for service; so that they might
not close their days with repining against fortune, and be oppressed with
the misery of want.”
</p>
<p>
Another anecdote of that period states, with somewhat more probability,
“That when the garrison was withdrawn from Tangiers, there was
among them a considerable number of aged and decrepid persons. It
was therefore proposed to build an hospital for them; and the king being
applied to for a piece of ground for the site, he offered the spot on which
king James’s College stood; but recollecting himself, ‘Odso,’ says he, ‘’tis
true I have already given that land to Nell, here.’ She, who was one of
the most generous and benevolent of human beings, immediately said,
‘Have you so, Charles? then I will return it to you again for this purpose;’
and the hospital was accordingly erected. The king however
built a house for Eleanor in Pall Mall.”
</p>
<p>
It is however very probable, according to Mr. Evelyn’s Memoirs, that
the design originated with Sir Stephen Fox, who for some years had been
paymaster of the forces, and certainly had better opportunities of becoming
acquainted with the wants and distresses of the aged and worn-out
veterans, great numbers of whom had been thrown on the charity of
the country at this period. The building was erected under the superintendence
of Sir C. Wren, and cost £150,000. It usually contains about
500 invalids; there are also a number of out-door pensioners, amounting
to about 85,000.]</p></div>

1705. In the year of the foundation an act was passed, 7 and 8 William

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="cock">COCK-FIGHTING.</h2>

<p>Until a recent period the English were almost the only
people among whom cock-fighting was a favourite amusement;
and on that account it is considered as peculiar to
them, though it was esteemed among various nations many
centuries ago. It is not improbable that it was first introduced
into England by the Romans. That it, however, has
been constantly retained there, though the practice of inciting
animals to fight has been long scouted by moral and
enlightened nations, is as singular an anomaly, as that the
Spaniards should still continue their bull-fights, and that
princes who wish to avoid the appearance of cruelty should nevertheless
pursue, with immoderate passion, the detestable and
so often condemned hunting with dogs. I shall leave to others
the task of moralising on these contradictions in the character
of whole nations as well as individuals, and shall here only give
the history of cock-fighting as far as I am acquainted with it.</p>

<p>This pastime is certainly very old; but I agree in opinion
with Mr. <span class="locked">Pegge<a name="FNanchor_1146" id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a></span>, that <span class="locked">Palmerius<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a></span> has made it much older
than can fully be proved. The latter supposes that Adrastus,
the son of Midas, king of Phrygia, killed his brother in
consequence of a quarrel which took place between them in
regard to a battle of quails. Adrastus on account of this
murder fled to Crœsus; and as that prince lived about 550<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
years before the Christian æra, quail-fighting, according to
the opinion of Palmerius, must have been customary at that
time; and in this case one might admit that cock-fighting
was of the same antiquity, because the battles of the domestic
cock are still more violent, and can afford more amusement.
<span class="locked">Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1148" id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a></span>, who relates the story of Adrastus, does
not mention the cause of the quarrel; but it is given by the
historian Ptolemy, the son of Hephestion, called also Alexandrinus,
who lived about the time of Trajan and <span class="locked">Adrian<a name="FNanchor_1149" id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a></span>. He
however only says that the two brothers quarrelled about a quail.
Did any other proofs exist that quail-fighting was common at
so early a period, it would indeed be then probable that the
brothers quarrelled during that pastime. But as no such proofs
are to be found, many other causes of quarrelling in regard to
a quail, either in catching or pursuing it, may be conceived.</p>

<p>It is however certain that quails, as well as the domestic
cock, are exceedingly irritable and quarrelsome birds; and
that, like the latter, they can be employed for fighting; but
it appears that quail-fighting was first practised by the Romans,
in whose writings it is frequently <span class="locked">mentioned<a name="FNanchor_1150" id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a></span>; whereas
among the Greeks it seldom or never occurs, while cock-fighting
is spoken of on many occasions. The latter however
sported with quails; but their pastime with these birds seems
not to have been fighting, properly so called, where the great
object of contest is whose quail shall be the victor; but the
information on this subject is so imperfect that it cannot be
fully <span class="locked">understood<a name="FNanchor_1151" id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a></span>. Sometimes the parties laid bets who could
kill the other’s quails, or the greatest number of them, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
one blow. One placed a quail within a circle, and another
endeavoured by irritating the animal to make it go beyond it.
If he proved successful in this attempt, he was declared the
winner. Several were often placed within a circle at the
same time, and the person lost whose bird first quitted it.
Kühn and others are of opinion, that each of the parties endeavoured
to induce the quail of the other to leave the circle,
by irritating or enticing it; but the words appear without
doubt to allude to a contest of several quails with each <span class="locked">other<a name="FNanchor_1152" id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a></span>,
were it possible that the later Greeks had learned to play at
this game from the contests of the Romans.</p>

<p>Solon, however, in <span class="locked">Lucian<a name="FNanchor_1153" id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a></span>, speaks of cock-fights and
quail-fights exhibited publicly at Athens. But Lucian lived
in the second century, had travelled into Italy, was well
acquainted with the Roman customs, and made Solon mention
quail-fighting, which he never saw in Greece, merely
because he himself had seen it in Italy. This blunder may
appear too gross, perhaps, for so acute a writer as Lucian;
but since he has fallen into two anachronisms in the same
dialogue, as he not only makes Solon a contemporary of Lycurgus,
who lived two centuries earlier, but also introduces
him as speaking of public cock-fights at Athens, which were
first established half a century later, that is to say, after the
battle of Marathon, he may readily have been guilty of a
third oversight, by transferring quail-fighting to Athens.
But at any rate similar games were usual in the island of
Cyprus in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that the Romans bred and employed
partridges for fighting in the same manner as quails. Lampridius
relates, that the emperor Alexander Severus was fond
of seeing battles of this <span class="locked">kind<a name="FNanchor_1154" id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a></span>; and Ælian, who lived in Italy
under Heliogabalus, in the second <span class="locked">century<a name="FNanchor_1155" id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a></span>, says that those
who kept partridges for fighting, when they pitted them
against each other, placed the females close to the males, in
order to render them more courageous. Without doubt he
here speaks of what was then usual at Rome.</p>

<p>Cock-fighting was appointed at Athens to be a public or
solemn pastime, in consequence of a circumstance which
occurred to Themistocles. At least Ælian <span class="locked">relates<a name="FNanchor_1156" id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a></span> that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
commander, when he led out the Greeks against the Persians,
happening to see two cocks fighting, took that opportunity
to rouse the courage of his soldiers, by telling them that as
these animals contended with so much obstinacy, though they
fought neither for their country, their families, nor their
liberty, but merely for the honour of victory, it was much
more incumbent on them to exert themselves with bravery,
as they had all these causes of incitement. Having defeated
the enemy, as a memorial of his victory and a future encouragement
to bravery, it was ordered that fighting-cocks
should be exhibited every year, in a public theatre, in the
presence of the whole people.</p>

<p>Mr. Pegge and others are of opinion that the Greeks afterwards
took so much pleasure in the fighting of these birds,
that they were generally employed throughout all Greece for
this pastime and for betting. I am ready to admit that this
is probable; but the institution of Themistocles appears to
me to be no proof that cock-fighting was not practised at an
earlier period. Even if it had been common, the Athenians
might have thought proper to establish a religious or at least
solemn cock-fighting to be exhibited every year. Themistocles
however is not the only person who employed the
courage of game-cocks as an incitement to bravery. Socrates
inspired Iphicrates with courage, by showing him with what
ferocity the cock of Midas, or Meidias, and that of Callias
attacked each <span class="locked">other<a name="FNanchor_1157" id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a></span>. What Themistocles said to his soldiers
was addressed by Musonius as a philosopher to mankind,
to encourage them to support labour, danger, and pain,
when duty or honour require <span class="locked">it<a name="FNanchor_1158" id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a></span>.</p>

<p>Many modern writers ascribe the establishment of public
cock-fighting at Athens, not to Themistocles, but to his contemporary
Miltiades. I have hitherto suspected that this
arises merely from a confusion of names, as is certainly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
case in Moses du <span class="locked">Soul<a name="FNanchor_1159" id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a></span>, where a reference is made to Ælian,
by whom however Miltiades is not mentioned. At present,
I am of opinion that Philo Judæus, who wrote in the first
century, gave occasion to this assertion. He relates, that
when Miltiades was about to lead the Grecian troops against
the Persians, he exhibited a cock-fight, in a place which had
been employed for public shows, in order to inspire courage
into his soldiers by this spectacle, and that the end proposed
was accomplished; but nothing is said by that author in regard
to the establishment of annual <span class="locked">cock-fights<a name="FNanchor_1160" id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a></span>. According
to this account, cock-fighting seems to have been at that time
not uncommon; but as it remains doubtful whether Philo speaks
of the campaign before the battle of Marathon, in which Miltiades
and Themistocles were both present, very little can be
gathered from his relation, and it appears to me not sufficient
to contradict the more circumstantial account of Ælian.</p>

<p>Another small mistake, which Pegge thought it worth
while to notice, deserves also perhaps to be rectified. <span class="locked">Dalechamp<a name="FNanchor_1161" id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a></span>
and <span class="locked">Potter<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a></span> assert that Themistocles, while leading
out his army, having heard a cock crow, declared this to be
an omen of victory, and after beating the enemy he instituted
cock-fighting in remembrance of that event. I shall here
remark, that Dalechamp is not the first person who made
this assertion. <span class="locked">Peucer<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a></span>, and at a period still earlier, Alexander
ab <span class="locked">Alexandro<a name="FNanchor_1164" id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a></span> mentioned the same thing, but no one
ever pointed out the passage in any ancient author upon
which this assertion was founded; and I have been as unsuccessful
in my endeavours to find it, as those who attempted to
discover the sources from which Alexander derived his information.
This author perhaps collected from manuscripts, in the
fifteenth century, many things never printed, and which therefore
have been lost. He may also have written many things
from memory without remembering them all with accuracy.</p>

<p>It is indeed true, that the crowing of a cock was sometimes
considered as a presage of victory. Thus Cicero quotes an
<span class="locked">instance<a name="FNanchor_1165" id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a></span> where a Bœotian soothsayer promised victory to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
the Thebans from the crowing of a cock; and according to
<span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1166" id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a></span>, the same circumstance once served to the Bœotians
as an omen of victory over the Lacedæmonians. How then
could Themistocles make choice of a cock-fight to commemorate
a victory announced by the crowing of a cock? Besides,
Anacharsis in Lucian confirms the object of the institution
assigned by Ælian. In the history of antiquity many things
are often repeated, without any one taking the trouble to
examine whether they can be proved by the testimony of the
ancients. Those who wish to attain to truth and certainty
in matters of this kind, will not consider such short examinations
to be of so little importance as they may to others appear.</p>

<p>Dempster has assigned another reason for the cock-fights
established by Themistocles, which, though adopted by many,
is not even supported by probability. He conceives that these
cock-fights were like a kind of permanent trophies or monuments
of the conquered Persians, because the game-cock was
indigenous in Persia, and conveyed thence to other <span class="locked">countries<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a></span>.</p>

<p>Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a>, indeed, quotes from a work of Menodotus
some lines by which the latter part of this assertion is confirmed;
and <span class="locked">Aristophanes<a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a></span> in two places calls the domestic
cock a Persian bird. It is proved by more modern accounts,
that this species of fowl is at present found wild in the East
Indies and many neighbouring countries. <span class="locked">Sonnerat<a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a></span> found
them in Hindostan; and they were seen by Cook and by
Dampier on Pulo Condor and many islands of the South
Sea. According to the testimony of Gemelli Careri, they
were indigenous in the Philippine islands, and according to
Morolla in the kingdom of Congo. That they are still found
wild in Georgia is asserted by <span class="locked">Reineggs<a name="FNanchor_1171" id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a></span>. The account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
therefore of the Greeks, that they obtained domestic fowls
from Persia, may be admitted; but as in cock-fights one
Persian overcame another, how could these convey the idea
of a victory of the Greeks over the Persians? Is the object,
then, as stated by Lucian and Ælian not sufficient and intelligible?</p>

<p>That cock-fighting, in the course of time, became a favourite
pastime among the people, is proved by the frequent
mention which is made of it in various authors. Pliny <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a></span>
that it was exhibited annually at Pergamus, in the same
manner as combats of gladiators. In this city, according to
<span class="locked">Petronius<a name="FNanchor_1173" id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a></span>, a boy was promised a fighting-cock; and therefore
it appears that boys kept cocks there for this pastime.
Æschines reproaches Timarchus with spending the whole
day in gaming and cock-fighting. <span class="locked">Plato<a name="FNanchor_1174" id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a></span> complains, that not
only boys but grown-up persons, instead of labouring, bred
birds for fighting, and employed their whole time in such
idle amusements.</p>

<p>Cock-fights were represented also by the Greeks on coins
and on cut stones. That the Dardani had them on their
coins we are told by <span class="locked">Pollux<a name="FNanchor_1175" id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a></span>; and this seems to prove that
these people were as fond of that sport as their neighbours of
Pergamus. Mr. Pegge caused engravings to be made of two
gems in the collection of Sir William Hamilton, on one of
which is seen a cock in the humble attitude of defeat, with
its head hanging down, and another in the attitude of victory,
with an ear of corn in its bill as the object of contest. On
the other stone two cocks are fighting, while a mouse carries
away the ear of corn for the possession of which they had
quarrelled; a happy emblem of our law-suits, in which the
greater part of the property in dispute falls to the lawyers
and attorneys. Two cocks in the attitude of fighting are
represented also on a lamp found in <span class="locked">Herculaneum<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a></span>.</p>

<p>That the Greeks employed various means to increase the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
irritability and courage of fighting-cocks is beyond all doubt.
Besides the circumstance already mentioned in regard to the
females, they gave them also food which produced nearly the
same effect as opium does in India, and as brandy did some
years ago on the European armies. <span class="locked">Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a></span> and <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a></span>
ascribe this effect to a plant which they call <i>adiantum</i>. The
former says it was given to game-cocks and quails, and the
latter that it was given to game-cocks and partridges, to
incite them to fight. Garlick, <i>allium</i>, was employed also,
as we are told by Xenophon, not only for game-cocks but
also for horses and soldiers. That the Greeks, however,
like the English at present, armed their cocks with steel
spurs, in order to render their battles more bloody, is denied
by Pegge; though the contrary seems to be proved by a passage
in Aristophanes, now become a proverb, and the remarks
of the <span class="locked">scholiast<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a></span>. As the English procure the strongest and
best fighting-cocks from other countries, and often from
Germany, through Hamburg, the Greeks, in the like manner,
obtained foreign game-cocks for the same <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a></span>.</p>

<p>Why the Romans showed more fondness for quail-fighting
than for cock-fighting I do not know; but it is certain that
they had not the latter, or at any rate only seldom and at a
late period, which appears to be very singular, as they began
then more and more to imitate the Greeks. Varro mentions
the breeds which were chiefly sought for in Greece; but he
adds, that though they might be good for fighting, they were
not fit for <span class="locked">breeding<a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a></span>. Had the breeding of game-cocks been
an employment, he would have spoken in a different manner.
Columella also ridicules the breeding of these cocks, as a
Grecian custom, and prefers the native race to all others.
Eustathius, in the place already quoted, says expressly that
the Romans preferred quails to game-cocks; yet in later
times we find mention among them of cock-fighting, as has
been before remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
There were cocks in England in the time of Julius Cæsar<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a>;
but it is said that they were kept there merely for pleasure, and
not used as food. The latter part of this account is not improbable.
The inhabitants of the Pelew Islands, we are told,
eat only the eggs of their hens, and not the flesh. But the
question, how old cock-fighting is in England, cannot be determined.
Pegge says, the oldest information which he found
on this subject was in the Description of the City of London
by William Fitz-Stephens, who lived in the reign of Henry II.,
and died in <span class="locked">1191<a name="FNanchor_1183" id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a></span>. This writer relates that every year on
Shrove Tuesday the boys at school brought their game-cocks
to the master, and the whole forenoon was devoted to cock-fighting,
for the amusement of the pupils. The theatre or
cock-pit, therefore, was in the school-house, and the pupils
seem to have had the direction of it. To this information I
can add, that cock-fighting in France was forbidden by a
council in 1260, on account of some mischief to which it had
given <span class="locked">rise<a name="FNanchor_1184" id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a></span>.</p>

<p>This pastime has been sometimes forbidden even in England,
as was the case under Edward III. and Henry VIII.;
also in the year 1569, and even later; but it was nevertheless
retained to a late period. Even Henry VIII. himself instituted
fights of this kind; and a writer worthy of credit relates,
that James I. took great delight in <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1185" id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a></span>. In modern times
this cruel amusement has been carried beyond all bounds; so
that the cock-fights in <span class="locked">China<a name="FNanchor_1186" id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a></span>, <span class="locked">Persia<a name="FNanchor_1187" id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a></span>, <span class="locked">Malacca<a name="FNanchor_1188" id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a></span>, and <span class="locked">America<a name="FNanchor_1189" id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a></span>,
are nothing in comparison of those called the <i>battle-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>royal</i>
and the <i>Welsh main</i>. In the former a certain number
of cocks are let loose to fight, and when they have destroyed
each other, the survivor is accounted the victor, and obtains
the prize. In the latter kind of battle, sixteen pair of cocks,
for example, being pitted against each other, the sixteen
conquerors are made to fight again; the eight of these which
are victors, must fight a third time; and the four remaining
a fourth time, till at length the two last conquerors terminate,
by a fifth contest, this murderous game, after thirty-one cocks
have successively butchered each other amidst the noisy exultation
of the spectators, who however make a pretence to
the character of magnanimity.</p>

<p>[Cock-fighting is one of the chief amusements throughout
the East Indies and China, and it is a fashionable pastime for
ladies in Peru. The spot on which the cock-pit Royal, which
was built in the reign of Charles II., existed, is now used for
the meetings of the members of Her Majesty’s Privy Council.
The custom of cock-throwing, that is, of throwing sticks at a
cock exposed at a stake and which was practised in this
country at Shrovetide, is supposed to have originated during
the war with France in the reign of Edward III., and to have
been considered a mark of hatred and contempt for the French
people, of whom that bird was the national emblem; but
the conjecture rests upon no solid authority and must be regarded
as mere legend.</p>

<p>Cock-fighting is now forbidden and punishable by law in
Great Britain, and every attempt is made to prevent this and
other similar barbarous sports and to convict the offenders, by
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.]</p>

<h2 id="saltpetre">SALTPETRE. GUNPOWDER. AQUAFORTIS.</h2>

<p>In examining the question, whether Theophrastus, Pliny, and
in general the ancient Greeks and Romans, were acquainted
with our saltpetre, or at what period it became known, I shall
perhaps meet with as little success as those who have preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
me in the same <span class="locked">research<a name="FNanchor_1190" id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a></span>. I shall therefore be satisfied if
competent judges allow that I have contributed anything new
that can tend to illustrate the subject.</p>

<p>Our saltpetre, which is commonly called <i>nitrum</i>, and sometimes,
though more rarely, <i>sal nitræ</i>, is a neutral salt composed
of a peculiar acid, named the acid of saltpetre or nitric acid,
and that alkali called potash. The characters by which it is
most readily distinguished from other salts are its cooling
taste, its fusibility when exposed to a small degree of heat,
and in particular its so-called deflagration; that is, the property
it has when placed in the fire, or on an ignited body, or
when melted in a crucible, with a combustible substance, of
suddenly bursting into a very bright flame, by which it loses
its acid, and nothing remains but a carbonate of potash. The
principal use of it is in making gunpowder, and for the preparation
of that acid known under the name of <span class="locked">aquafortis<a name="FNanchor_1191" id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a></span>,
which is employed in various ways.</p>

<p>Native saltpetre is so rare, that Cronstedt was not acquainted
with it. At present, however, it is known to occur in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
the East Indies, in the lower part of Italy, also in <span class="locked">Portugal<a name="FNanchor_1192" id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a></span>,
Spain, America, and some other <span class="locked">countries<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a></span>. But almost all
the saltpetre obtained in Europe is produced partly by nature
and partly by art. The putrefaction of organic bodies gives
rise, under certain circumstances, to nitric acid, which in general
combines with calcareous earth wherever it finds it,
and forms the so-called earthy saltpetre. This is decomposed
by potash, and the latter uniting with the acid forms common
saltpetre. Sometimes also it is found that the nitric acid,
instead of being united with calcareous earth, is combined with
soda, which produces the so-called cubic <span class="locked">saltpeter<a name="FNanchor_1194" id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a></span>. Both
these saline substances, but the earthy more frequently than
the cubic, are often found on effloresced walls; and both are
then comprehended under the common names of <i>Mauersalz</i>
or <i>Mauerbeschlag</i>, <i>sal murale</i>.</p>

<p>This efflorescence on walls was observed, in all probability,
at a very early period, especially as it is produced in many
parts in great abundance, and as it makes itself perceptible
by the decay of walls, which it seems to corrode. It is the
plague or leprosy of houses mentioned in the Mosaic code of
laws. As the ancients were so much inclined to expect
medicinal virtue in all natural bodies, there is reason to think
that they soon collected and made trial of this saline incrustation.
That this indeed was actually the case, and that they
gave the name of <i>nitrum</i> to this saline mass, may be proved
from their writings. Their <i>nitrum</i>, however, must have been
exceedingly various in its properties. For this incrustation is
not always calcareous saltpetre; it is often <span class="locked">soda<a name="FNanchor_1195" id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a></span>, mixed with
more or less calcareous earth; and sometimes it consists of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
salts of sulphuric acid. In modern times, on closer examination,
other salts of nitric acid have been found in the incrustation
of walls, such as flaming saltpetre or nitrate of ammonia,
bitter saltpetre or nitrate of magnesia; but of these no mention
can be expected in the works of the ancients.</p>

<p>Substances so different ought not indeed to have been all
named <i>nitrum</i>; but before natural history began to be formed
into a regular system, mankind in general fell into an error
directly contrary to that committed at present. Objects essentially
different were comprehended under one name, if
they any how corresponded with each other even in things
accidental. Whereas at present every variety, however small,
obtains a distinct appellation; because many wish to have the
pleasure, if not of forming new species, at any rate of giving
new names. The elephant and rhinoceros were formerly
called oxen; the sable and ermine were named mice, and the
ostrich was distinguished by the appellation of sparrow. In
the like manner, calcareous saltpetre and alkali might be
called <i>nitrum</i>. The ancients, however, gave to their <i>nitrum</i>
some epithets, but they seem to have been used only to denote
uncommon varieties.</p>

<p>Now, as the ancients were not acquainted with any accurate
method of separating and distinguishing salts, it needs excite
no wonder that they should ascribe to their <i>nitrum</i> properties
which could not possibly be united in a salt, and much less
exist in our saltpetre. But as they were neither acquainted
with aquafortis nor manufactured gunpowder, and as no
particular use of calcareous saltpetre was known, the <i>nitrum</i>
most valuable to them must have been that which consisted
chiefly of soda, and which consequently could be employed
in washing, in painting, and in glass-making.</p>

<p>It is well known that in warm countries this alkali effloresces
here and there from the earth, particularly in a dry soil, and
even in such quantity as to be employed in commerce. Hence
it may be readily comprehended why this effloresced salt,
which is very often mixed with common salt, obtained the
name of <i>nitrum</i>.</p>

<p>The important discovery, that a similar salt, having the
like properties, and applicable to the same uses, named at present
soda, may be obtained from the ashes of certain plants,
was first made, in my opinion, by the ancient Egyptians or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
<span class="locked">Arabians<a name="FNanchor_1196" id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a></span>. This salt also, at least by the Greeks, was named
<i>nitrum</i>, or considered as a species of it. By the incineration
of the plants this salt was rendered slightly caustic; and it
then became moist in the air, and deliquesced when not preserved
in very close vessels. It was therefore like those salts
which are obtained, in the same manner, from the ashes of
all other plants; though the latter are essentially different
from the former, and in the course of time obtained the peculiar
appellation of potash or pearlash. One can hardly be
surprised that the ancients were not able to distinguish soda
from potash, especially as they were both obtained from vegetable
ashes.</p>

<p>But were the ancients, under the ambiguous name of <i>nitrum</i>,
acquainted with our saltpetre? There is certainly reason
to think that it became known to them by lixiviating
earths impregnated with salts. There are, as already said,
not only in India but also in Africa, and particularly in
Egypt, earths which, without the addition of ashes or potash,
give real saltpetre, like that of the rubbish-hills on the road
from new to old <span class="locked">Cairo<a name="FNanchor_1197" id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a></span>, and like the earth in some parts of
Spain. It is a knowledge only of this natural kind of saltpetre,
which required no artificial composition, that can be
allowed to the ancients, as it does not appear by their writings
that they were sufficiently versed in chemistry to prepare the
artificial kind used at present.</p>

<p>But even admitting that they had our saltpetre, where and
by what means can we be convinced of it? Is it to be expected
that any of the before-mentioned characters or properties
of this salt should occur in their writings? They
neither made aquafortis nor gunpowder; and they seem
scarcely to have had any occasion or opportunity to discover
its deflagration and the carbonization thereby effected, or,
when observed, to examine and describe it. No other use of
our saltpetre which could properly announce this phenomenon
has yet been known. How then can it be ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
that under the term <i>nitrum</i> they sometimes meant our saltpetre?</p>

<p>Those inclined to believe too little rather than too much,
who cannot be satisfied with mere conjectures or probabilities,
but always require full proof, will acknowledge with me,
that the first certain accounts of our saltpetre cannot be expected
much before the invention of aquafortis and gunpowder.
It deserves also to be remarked, that the real saltpetre,
as soon as it became known, was named also <i>nitrum</i>; but, by
way of distinction, either <i>sal nitrum</i>, or <i>sal nitri</i>, or <i>sal petræ</i>.
The first appellation, from which our ancestors made <i>salniter</i>,
was occasioned by an unintelligible passage of Pliny, which I
shall afterwards point out. The two other names signify,
like <i>sal tartari</i>, <i>sal succini</i>, a salt which was not <i>nitrum</i> but
obtained from <i>nitrum</i>. <i>Sal-nitri</i>, therefore, or <i>salniter</i>, was
that salt which, according to the representation of the ancients,
was separated by art from <i>nitrum</i>, yet was essentially
different from the <i>nitrum</i> or soda commonly in use. Biringoccio
says expressly, that the artificial <i>nitrum</i>, for the sake
of distinction, was named, not <i>nitrum</i>, but <i>sal nitrum</i>.</p>

<p>The name <i>nitrum</i> is of great antiquity, and seems to have
been conveyed from Egypt and Palestine to Greece, and
thence to Italy and every part of Europe. For it is evidently
the <i>neter</i> mentioned by the prophet Jeremiah, chap.
ii. ver. 22; and which occurs also in the Proverbs of Solomon,
chap. xxv. ver. 20. But whether the name <i>nitrum</i>, as
Jerome <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_1198" id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a></span>, be derived from the Egyptian province <i>Nitria</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
whence it was exported in great abundance, or the name of
the province was derived from <i>nitrum</i>, is a question of little
importance in regard to this research. <i>Nitron</i> is mentioned
by Herodotus, where he describes the Egyptian method of
embalming dead <span class="locked">bodies<a name="FNanchor_1199" id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a></span>; by some of the Greeks the word
was written and pronounced <i>litron</i>. In the same manner
people say <i>nympha</i> and <i>lympha</i>. In order to avoid confusion,
I shall here call the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients nitrum, and
the <i>nitrum</i> of the mineralogists saltpetre.</p>

<p>In the course of time men became acquainted with the
purer, more useful, and cheaper mineral alkali which was
furnished, under the name of soda, by the Moors and inhabitants
of the southern countries, who had learned the method
of preparing it. The vegetable alkali also was always more
and more manufactured in woody districts, as an article in
great request, and sold under the name of potash, <i>cineres clavellati</i>.
All knowledge of the impure alkali from the incrustation
of walls was then lost; and as there was no further
need of guarding against confusion, it was not longer thought
worth while to name saltpetre <i>sal nitri</i>: it was called <i>nitrum</i>;
and the oldest signification of this word being forgotten, it
was admitted without further examination, that the <i>nitrum</i> of
the ancients was nothing else than our saltpetre.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century some learned Europeans, while
travelling through the East, heard the name <i>natrum</i> given to
the mineral alkali which was then exported as an article of
commerce, and introduced in their works this transformation
of the ancient word <i>nitrum</i>. This appellation was employed
by the systematic mineralogists, who, giving themselves little
trouble about the original meaning of words, and taking care
only to avoid confusion, called the mineral alkali also <i>natrum</i>,
and applied the name of <i>nitrum</i> to saltpetre. As far as I
know at present, it was first stated by Peter Bellon and Prosper
<span class="locked">Alpinus<a name="FNanchor_1200" id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a></span>, that the mineral alkali was in the East called
<i>natrum</i>. The former returned in 1549, and the latter was
still in Cairo in 1580.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
This word was adopted in mineralogy by Linnæus, in the
year 1736, as the name of a species, in which he comprehended
for the first time the alkaline incrustation found on
walls. In this he is followed by Wallerius, who includes also
the mineral alkali from the East. Afterwards the word <i>natrum</i>
was employed in the same sense by all mineralogists.</p>

<p>It deserves here to be remarked, that Boyle had even examined
and determined the difference between the fixed and
volatile alkalies; but that mineralogists and chemists, till the
latest periods, believed that all fixed alkali arose, or at least
was obtained, by the incineration of plants. The difference
between the mineral and vegetable alkalies was first defined,
in a proper manner, by the exertion of the German chemists
Pott, Model and <span class="locked">Marggraf<a name="FNanchor_1201" id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a></span>; especially after the last had
proved, in the year 1758, that the basis of common salt was
not, as had before been generally believed, an alkaline earth,
but a fixed alkali, to which, because it was in many of its
properties different from the fixed vegetable alkali, he gave
the name of fixed mineral alkali. Soon after this substance
was discovered in mineral springs; and Model and others
have shown that it is not essentially different from that which
in the East is called <i>natrum</i>.</p>

<p>It is singular, and yet may be accounted for, that since
that time many have spoken of the <i>nitrum</i> and <i>natrum</i> of the
ancients, though they are only different pronunciations of the
same word; and <i>natrum</i> is never found in the works of the
Greeks or the Romans, and not even in writings of the middle
ages.</p>

<p>But if the greater part of what I have here said should be
considered only as conjecture, it must nevertheless be acknowledged
that it is deduced from the nature of the thing;
and when impartially compared with what we read in the
ancients, the latter I hope will be better understood than it
hitherto has been; the impropriety of many readings will become
apparent, and the truth of this conjecture be admitted.</p>

<p>Were I here to relate everything that we read of <i>nitrum</i>,
in order to compare it with nature and to examine it thoroughly,
I should be obliged to extend this article to a greater
length than might be agreeable to the reader. I shall therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
give only the principal proofs of my assertion, premising,
that doubts which might be excited by single passages not
here mentioned, will, on a closer comparison, vanish without
my assistance. But I maintain that those who wish to explain
the old names of natural objects must relate everything
said of them, and not that alone which is favourable to their
opinion, and which may be often contradicted by what was
purposely or accidentally concealed. The first part of such
an examination is always a careful collection from the writings
of the ancients of all the predicates of the natural object, the
systematic name of which one is endeavouring to prove.</p>

<p>There is reason however to conjecture, that the ancients,
in the history of their impure nitre, the manner of obtaining
which the Romans at least had no opportunity themselves of
seeing, for Pliny says expressly that it was not procured in
Italy, fell into many errors and mistakes, which at present
cannot all be explained.</p>

<p>Hence it happened that the ancients did not understand
the art of purifying the salt which they obtained from minerals;
and therefore they were obliged to use it in the same
impure state in which they found it. On this account they
considered each natural mixture as a peculiar kind; gave to
the greater part of them, or those most useful, particular
names; and of these recommended for different purposes
those which, according to their purity or mixture, or according
to other circumstances, were the most convenient. It is
not probable that all these varieties could be again found out
or defined; and it seems to be of little importance, when it is
known that the names denote nothing more than the varieties
of a mineral.</p>

<p>In this examination it is to be regretted that the book of
Theophrastus, in which he expressly treated of <i>nitrum</i>, has not
been preserved. But it may be believed, even without the
testimony of Pliny, that he was one of the most accurate and
acute naturalists among the ancients, and that he gave the best
account of this <span class="locked">substance<a name="FNanchor_1202" id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a></span>. It must, however, be admitted
that Pliny thoroughly understood this author, and gave a correct
extract from him, and that the transcriber fell into no
mistake.</p>

<p>That the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients was an alkali more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
impure, but not saltpetre, has been long admitted by those who
had the least knowledge of mineralogy, as well as by the most
sagacious physicians. The grounds for this opinion, as far as I
have yet learned, are as follows: more indeed might be found,
but these are sufficient to afford a complete proof. Galen, a
cautious writer, says that <i>nitrum</i> was in general burnt, by
which means its effects were <span class="locked">strengthened<a name="FNanchor_1203" id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a></span>. Had it been saltpetre,
it is impossible that the ancients should not in burning
it have observed its deflagration, and this property is too remarkable
not to have been mentioned. But nothing is to be
found that can with any probability be supposed to allude
to it.</p>

<p>But should it be admitted without any grounds that it was
not an alkali but saltpetre which they burnt, it must certainly
have been carbonized; for a burning body may easily have
fallen into the crucible, and in general <i>nitrum</i> seems to have
been burnt in an open fire, like our lime, because Pliny, speaking
of the Egyptian, considers the contrary as somewhat uncommon.
Physicians then, at any rate, must have observed,
that a body very different both in its appearance and effects
was produced from saltpetre by burning, but which could not
be used for any other purpose than that salt. Of this however
we do not find the least intimation.</p>

<p>But <i>nitrum</i> was undoubtedly soda, and on that account
when burnt must have become more caustic as well as stronger
in most of its effects, and in this respect similar to potash,
since [owing to impurities] it in the same manner became
moist and deliquesced in the air. What Pliny relates of the
Egyptian <i>nitrum</i> becomes then intelligible. The latter, he
says, was transported in pitched vessels, because it would
otherwise have deliquesced; and he afterwards adds, that it
was burnt before it was sent off. Had he known that the latter
was the cause and the former the effect, he would have
mentioned the latter first; but his whole extract, in regard to
nitre, is written in general without order. The vessels, no
doubt, were of clay; but whether he means in what he adds
that they were not burnt but only baked in the sun, or that
before they were filled they were completely dried in the sun,
has been determined by no commentator. To me the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
is the more probable. Pliny also mentions another circumstance
in regard to the burning of the Egyptian <i>nitrum</i>;
namely, that it must be done in a close vessel, otherwise it
would decrepitate or fly off. This is perfectly intelligible,
when it is considered that it contained a great deal of common
salt, which alone possessed the property of decrepitating;
and it is well known in mineralogy that native soda, and even
that which in modern times has been introduced into our collections
from Tripoli, and of which I have in my possession a
specimen, contains common <span class="locked">salt<a name="FNanchor_1204" id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a></span>, and often in cubic crystals.
Pliny had just reason to add, that <i>nitrum</i> otherwise does not
properly decrepitate. The ancients were well acquainted with
the resemblance of their <i>nitrum</i> to lime, and especially of that
which was burnt. On this account, because the Egyptian
was exported after it had been burnt, it could easily be mixed
with quicklime, or, as Pliny says, be adulterated. But the
proof which he gives he does not seem to have thoroughly
understood. The Egyptian must at all times have been caustic
(<i>pungens</i>) even without lime; but that which was mixed
with lime could not so speedily or completely dissolve on the
tongue as that which was pure, and left behind it more earth.
What he says of a test by the smell, I cannot understand in
any other manner than that burnt lime, when moistened with
water, diffused that disagreeable vapour observed in apartments
the walls of which have been newly plastered; though
when the quantity is small this is hardly perceptible.</p>

<p>If I understand <span class="locked">Theophrastus<a name="FNanchor_1205" id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a></span> properly, he seems to say,
that if <i>nitrum</i> be burnt as soon as it is dug up, it communicates
heat to water in the same manner as lime. It may here
be seen how great a resemblance the ancients found between
their <i>nitrum</i>, alkaline earth and lime.</p>

<p>The similarity of wood-ashes to the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients,
which they acknowledged, proves also that it was in reality
an alkaline salt. We are told by <span class="locked">Theophrastus<a name="FNanchor_1206" id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a></span> that <i>nitrum</i>
was said to be produced from oak-ashes; and <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1207" id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a></span>, who
borrowed from this writer, remarks that it was certain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
ashes of that wood were nitrous. He ascribes also to burnt
wine-lees the nature and properties of <i>nitrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1208" id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a>. Nay he considers
as a kind of <i>nitrum</i> those saline ashes which, in many
countries destitute of salt, were used for seasoning food, and
which were prepared by pouring sea-water or salt brine over
burning piles of wood, gradually and in small quantities, so
that the fire was not extinguished, by which means the water
evaporated, leaving the salt behind, but mixed indeed with
charcoal, ashes, earth, and alkaline salts; consequently it must
have been moist, or at any rate nauseous, if not refined by a
new solution. This method of preparing or boiling salt, which
perhaps is the oldest, has been mentioned by various writers;
but many of them, through ignorance or neglect, have not told
us that sea-water or brine was employed, as they speak in such
a manner as if any kind and even fresh water had been used
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Varro relates that he saw this process employed on the
<span class="locked">Rhine<a name="FNanchor_1209" id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a></span>. Pliny <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_1210" id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a></span> that oak timber had before been burnt for
that purpose. In another place he mentions a similar process
among the Gauls and the <span class="locked">Germans<a name="FNanchor_1211" id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a></span>, as Tacitus does among
the Hermanduri and the <span class="locked">Catti<a name="FNanchor_1212" id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a></span>. The former also states, on
the authority of Theophrastus, that the Umbri burnt salt in
the like <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_1213" id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a></span>. It is however certain that Pliny and other
ancient writers often quote from Theophrastus what, at present,
is not to be found in the works of that naturalist, but in
those of his preceptor <span class="locked">Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_1214" id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a></span>.</p>

<p>Pliny adds, that this paltry method of obtaining salt had
been long given up; and this indeed was the natural consequence
of increased civilization. It is however certain that
it was long continued in many countries, and in some still
exists.</p>

<p>About two centuries ago the inhabitants of the province
of Zeeland, descendants perhaps of the Catti, used no other
salt than what they obtained in the like manner, from mud
thrown up by the sea, which they burned and moistened with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
sea-water, as we are told by Lemnius, who was himself a native
of that country. Boxhorn says, in his annotations on the
above-quoted passage of Tacitus, that he saw a painting at
Zirkzee, in which the whole process was represented. It is
probable that salt was boiled exactly in the same manner as
at some of the Sleswic islands, described by <span class="locked">Denkwerth<a name="FNanchor_1215" id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a></span>,
from whose account it is seen that the <i>glebæ marinæ</i>, of which
Lemnius speaks, consisted of mud mixed with roots growing
in them; and that the salt when afterwards refined was called
there Frisic, in all probability because the inhabitants had
learned to make it from their ancestors the Frieslanders. I
remember somewhere to have read that salt was made for a
long time in this manner by the so-called Wurst-Frieslanders,
in the country of Wurst, belonging to the duchy of Bremen.
The inhabitants also of the Austrian part of Moldavia, or
Buccowina as it is called, still use a salt, which they do not
boil, but burn with their superfluous wood, in the like manner
from the brine of a saline spring. A member of the former
Academy of <span class="locked">Brussels<a name="FNanchor_1216" id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a></span> took the trouble to examine the
process as described by the ancients, and obtained, as might
certainly have been expected, a highly alkaline kind of common
salt, similar to that which Pliny, not without reason,
considered as a sort of <i>nitrum</i>, because undoubtedly it may
oftener have been an alkaline carbonate than common salt.</p>

<p>Boerhaave<a name="FNanchor_1217" id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a>, in quoting the passages of the ancients, did
not reflect that, during the incineration of the wood, salt water
was poured over it. He considered the whole process as a
burning of potash, and thought that the salt obtained was fit
for use only because it was made according to the manner of
Tachenius. That indeed gives a carbonated salt, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
almost saponaceous, and so mixed with various parts of the
burnt plants that it is much milder, consequently fitter for
use than common soda or pearlash can be; but that salt was
not so much of the Tachenian kind as a species of common
salt superabundant in alkali.</p>

<p>If the <i>nitrum</i> was carbonated alkali, there is reason to suppose
that the ancients must have occasionally mentioned in
their writings that it effervesced with acids. With the mineral
acids indeed they were not acquainted; but they had
vinegar, and that <i>nitrum</i> produced with this an effervescence
had been known in the oldest times. A very clear allusion
to this circumstance is found in the book of Proverbs, chap.
xxv. ver. 20; where Luther however translates the word by
<i>chalk</i>. Jerome, whose explanation I have already quoted,
was in some degree acquainted with this phænomenon; and
therefore to him the comparison of Solomon was <span class="locked">intelligible<a name="FNanchor_1218" id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a></span>.
But at present I can produce no proofs from Greek writers;
though they might have occurred during the use of <i>nitrum</i>
in medicine, in consequence of which it was often put into
vinegar.</p>

<p>We shall be further convinced what <i>nitrum</i> really was,
when the uses to which it was applied, as mentioned in the
works of the ancients, are considered. The most common, as
soap was not then known, appears to have been in washing, a
purpose for which our saltpetre would not be fit; besides, it
is at all times too scarce and too dear. I shall not here adduce
any proofs of its being employed in this manner, as they
often occur, and as several have been already given in the preceding
<span class="locked">volume<a name="FNanchor_1219" id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a></span>. Many salves and cosmetics were prepared
with <i>nitrum</i>; and in all probability articles of this kind, used
chiefly among the women, are to be understood by the term
<i>nitron parthenicon</i>, which occurs in Nicholas Myrepsius, in
the beginning of the fourteenth century; <i>matronicon</i>, mentioned
by the same, and by Alexander of Tralles, about the
year 565; and the <i>nitrum matronale</i> of Marcellus Empiricus,
in the fifth century. That the use of it for washing still continues
in the East, is confirmed in various books of travels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
The oldest glass, of the preparation of which any account
is to be found in history, was made by means of <i>nitrum</i> or
mineral alkali. For though I doubt that it could have been
produced on the sandy banks of the Belus, where some merchants,
when cooking, supported their pots with lumps of
<i>nitrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1220" id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a>, because sand is not so easily brought to a state of
fusion; it at any rate remains certain, that this supposed fusion
with our saltpetre is altogether impossible.</p>

<p>The use of <i>nitrum</i> for painting announces, without doubt,
an alkaline carbonate, and not <span class="locked">saltpetre<a name="FNanchor_1221" id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a></span>; and the case is the
same with the various uses in the cookery of the ancients,
many of which we have still retained. It was added to bread
in baking, according to <span class="locked">Pliny<a name="FNanchor_1222" id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a></span>, in the stead of salt, but probably
to promote its rising, for which purpose it is still employed
by the Egyptians, as potash was by our bakers. For
this use the mineral alkali was formerly brought from the
Levant to France, till it was declared by the physicians to be
injurious to the <span class="locked">health<a name="FNanchor_1223" id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a></span>.</p>

<p>When meat which was too fresh was to be dressed, it was
put into <i>nitrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1224" id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a>, in order to make it tender; and, according
to Forskäl and others, this is still practised in the East. Our
cooks also know that smoked meat, fish and other dried provisions
become more tender when placed in a ley of potash,
or when a little potash is added while they are boiling.</p>

<p><i>Nitrum</i>, however, was employed for curing articles of food
which people wished to preserve. This appears to contradict
what has been mentioned above; but in all probability
a caustic sort was used for the former purpose; but for the
latter a mild kind, mixed with a great deal of common salt.
There were so many species, that some of them might have
been applied to quite contrary purposes.</p>

<p>As I conjecture, the use of <i>nitrum</i> for causing chestnuts
and other husky fruits to boil soft, was also known: to produce
the same effect, potash is at present thrown among boiling
lentils and peas. I am inclined to think that for this reason
Apicius caused chestnuts to be boiled with nitre.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that this effect of alkaline carbonates
induced agriculturists to believe that beans, peas, lentils and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
other leguminous fruits, if steeped, before they were sown, in
water in which nitre had been dissolved, or if the dung spread
over the earth had been mixed with nitre, the future product
could be more easily boiled <span class="locked">soft<a name="FNanchor_1225" id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a></span>. However useful this addition
may be in cookery, it would produce little effect on seed;
and it appears to me that the old agriculturists placed little confidence
in the last-mentioned use, because they were not agreed
in regard to the result. Virgil and others seem to expect from
it an increase of the <span class="locked">fruit<a name="FNanchor_1226" id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a></span>; but others, security against beetles,
which eat the fruit and leave the husks <span class="locked">empty<a name="FNanchor_1227" id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a></span>. When cabbages
were transplanted they were strewed over with nitre, and
by these means were said to come sooner to <span class="locked">maturity<a name="FNanchor_1228" id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a></span>. Radishes
also were treated in the same manner, or besprinkled
with nitrous water, in order to make them more <span class="locked">tender<a name="FNanchor_1229" id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a></span>.</p>

<p>A common method employed by the ancient cooks to give
a beautiful green colour to pickled or boiled vegetables, was
to add <i>nitrum</i> to them while boiling; but this effect could be
produced by <i>natrum</i>, and not by the <i>nitrum</i> of the moderns,
or that neutral salt called <span class="locked">saltpetre<a name="FNanchor_1230" id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a></span>.</p>

<p>Among the oldest accounts of <i>nitrum</i> is that where it is
mentioned as being employed for embalming dead bodies.
It would be tiresome to read over and examine everything
written on that subject by the learned; but this much I think
is clear, that either the flesh, and in general the softer parts
of the body could be corroded in the course of seventy days
by the Egyptian <span class="locked">nitrum<a name="FNanchor_1231" id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a></span>, which, as above shown, was burnt,
and in general mixed with unslaked lime, and consequently
<span class="locked">caustic<a name="FNanchor_1232" id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a></span>; or that the moist parts could be desiccated by carbonate
alkali, in the same manner as the manufacturers of
parchment purify and dry their skins by the application of
chalk. That saltpetre in no case could be useful for this
purpose needs hardly be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
The ancient physicians, who were unacquainted with our
numerous class of salts, employed their <i>nitrum</i> in many ways,
and for a great variety of mixtures; but no writer, as far as
I know, ever took the trouble to examine these recipes, though
it has long since been declared that <i>nitrum</i> must have been
potash or salt of tartar. <span class="locked">Matthioli<a name="FNanchor_1233" id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a></span> asserted, that those physicians
would act very improperly who should prescribe our
saltpetre where the ancients employed their <i>nitrum</i>; and indeed
those in the least acquainted with the effects of salts
must know, that all those extolled by the ancients announce
carbonated alkalies. Thus burnt <i>nitrum</i> was employed for
cleaning black teeth, as at present many use tobacco ashes
instead of tooth-powder. It is seen by the works of Aretæus
and others, that burnt <i>nitrum</i> was used as a caustic, till people
learned in modern times to prepare the more active <i>causticum
potentiale</i>, or <i>sal causticum</i>.</p>

<p>What the ancients say of the taste of their <i>nitrum</i> seems,
however, not entirely applicable to pure carbonated alkali;
and much less, or not at all, to our saltpetre. Had they
meant the latter, they would certainly not have failed to mention
the sensation of coolness which it occasions when applied
to the tongue. Galen and Aetius say, that <i>nitrum</i> is as bitter
as gall; but Serapio ascribes to it a saline taste, with a
small degree of bitterness; as does also Pliny, only that for
bitterness he substitutes the word sharpness. The names of
tastes, however, are as uncertain as the names of the colours
which occur in the works of the ancients. Both certainly deserve
to be more accurately examined, and to be defined by
comparing the things to which these names are given. Prosper
Alpinus, however, is of opinion that what the ancients
called <i>amarum</i>, is not inapplicable to the taste of <i>natrum</i>.</p>

<p>The ancients mention various springs and streams which
contained what they called <i>nitrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1234" id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a>; but nitrous water, according
to the present acceptation of the word, that is, water
which contains saltpetre, does not exist; and if credit is to be
given to Marggraf and others, that they observed traces of
saltpetre in some kinds of water, the instances must have been
so rare that mention of them could not be expected among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
the ancients. Their nitrous water was undoubtedly alkaline,
and this indeed is not scarce. Such water was recommended
by the ancient physicians, both for bathing and <span class="locked">drinking<a name="FNanchor_1235" id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a></span>;
and Pliny says, it was singular that the salt of such water
would not shoot into crystals, like common salt, which is undoubtedly
<span class="locked">true<a name="FNanchor_1236" id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a></span>.</p>

<p>Alkaline water of this kind, such as that of Armenia, was
used for washing, and also by fullers. In Egypt, at present,
people wash in the same manner with <i>nitrum</i>.</p>

<p>It appears to me that many kinds of water, which were
only impure and not potable on account of their nauseous
taste, were considered by the ancients as nitrous. This seems
to be proved by the means which they propose for rendering
nitrous water fit to be drunk; that is, by throwing into it clay,
or some grains of <span class="locked">barley<a name="FNanchor_1237" id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a></span>. In the like manner, I saw the
brewers at Amsterdam improve their dirty water, in some
degree, by putting into it kneaded clay, and allowing it to
sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>One foundation more for my assertion may be found, I
think, in the name <i>borax</i>. The ancient <i>nitrum</i> by the Arabians
was called <i>Bauracon</i> or <i>Baurach</i>. When that salt,
which at present is everywhere called borax, became known
to the Arabians, it was at first generally considered as a kind
of nitre, and on that account called <i>Baurach</i>, because in most
of its properties it approached near to the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients,
that is, the <i>natrum</i> of the present day. But afterwards,
when the difference became known, our borax, at least in
Europe, retained exclusively the general name of <i>Baurach</i>,
from which at length was formed the present word <i>borax</i>.
My conclusion therefore is, that the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients
must have been mineral alkali; otherwise it is impossible
that our borax, which till modern times was reckoned to be
mineral alkali, should have been considered as a <i>nitrum</i>.</p>

<p>For many centuries past, the people in Africa and Asia,
and also in Spain and Sicily, have cultivated some kinds of
plants, which they dry and then burn to ashes. By regulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
the fire in a particular manner, they cause these ashes to assume
a certain degree of concretion, or vitrification, by which
means they are formed into solid cakes of a grey colour, interspersed
with many white and black spots. This substance,
which in consequence of the vitrification does not become
moist in the air, is broken into fragments, and sent to every
part of Europe under the name of <i>soda</i>, for the use of the
glass-houses, soap-boilers, dyers, and for other purposes.</p>

<p>These plants were undoubtedly first cultivated and employed
in Europe by the Arabians, who made known the use of them.
Those first or chiefly employed were named by them <i>axnan</i>,
<i>usnan</i>, <i>usnen</i>, or <i>uscnanon</i>; and also <i>Hasciscio alcali</i>, that is,
<i>herba kali</i>, the plant or herb kali, because the name <i>kali</i>, or,
with the article prefixed, <i>al kali</i>, was not given to the plant but
to the half-vitrified ashes <i>kali</i>. Hence the chemists call salts
obtained from the ashes of plants, alkaline salts. I do not
know how old this appellation may be; but it is to be found
in Vincent Bellovacensis and in the interpolated writings of
Geber and Avicenna, and particularly in a passage quoted by
the former from an old alchemist named Jahie, where it is
called <i>sal alchali</i><a name="FNanchor_1238" id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a>. All these salts formerly were considered
as nitrous salts, or a kind of <i>nitrum</i>. It was indeed soon observed
that soda and wood-ashes, which from the earliest
periods had been burnt in woody districts, and which are
now called potash, were not all of the same nature; but when
the difference between the mineral and vegetable alkalies began
to be studied, it was then known that soda contains the
former, that is, our <i>natrum</i>, and potash the latter, but both
indeed often rendered impure by earthy and foreign saline
particles; and that there are many plants from the ashes of
which mineral and not vegetable alkali is obtained. A question
now arises, How old in the Levant is the method of preparing
this <i>natrum</i> from the ashes of plants?</p>

<p>Michaelis is of opinion that it is mentioned in Malachi,
chap. iii. ver. 2; which passage I shall give according to
Luther’s translation: “Who shall stand when he appeareth?
for he is like the fire of the goldsmith, and the soap of the
scourer. He will sit and melt and purify the silver, and
make pure like gold and silver.” This learned man here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
seems to think that the sacred writer alludes to refining the
noble metals, and that the word <i>borith</i> means soda, which indeed
may serve as a flux in the purification of them. I at
first considered this meaning as true; but, on closer examination,
I am fully convinced that we have both erred.</p>

<p>Those who read without prejudice the above passage of
Malachi, must remark, that a double comparison or double
image is employed. The messenger there promised was to
separate the good from the bad, the clean from the unclean.
The first occupation is compared with the labour of the gold-refiner;
the other, with that of the scourer of clothes. The
first image is afterwards heightened, because the poet, in all
probability, was desirous of applying the separation of the
ignoble parts, such as slag, by means of fire, as being the
stronger image which denotes punishment, in a closer manner
to the Levites and priests. At the time of the poet, before
the invention of soap, people employed for washing either
nitre or the saponaceous juice of certain plants, which I have
already endeavoured to determine. The <i>borith</i> of the washer
there expressly named, was undoubtedly one of these soap
plants, and not the half-vitrified ashes either of soda or
potash.</p>

<p>This passage of Malachi was so understood in the oldest
times. Professor Tychsen, a true pupil and intimate friend
of Michaelis, to whose opinion I subjected my doubts, assured
me that Michaelis was never able to convince him of the justness
of his exposition; especially as <span class="locked">Jerome<a name="FNanchor_1239" id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a></span>, without the least
hesitation, understood <i>borith</i> to be a plant growing in Palestine,
and used there for washing; and as the Greek translators,
who were much nearer to the period of the poet, and
could not be unacquainted with a thing so much used, have
translated <i>borith</i> by the word <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">ποα</span>, a plant.</p>

<p>In Jeremiah, chap. ii. ver. <span class="locked">22<a name="FNanchor_1240" id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a></span>, both the substances formerly
used for washing, <i>nitrum</i> and the soap-plant, are so clearly
named, that Michaelis was obliged to admit that we cannot
understand there soda or potash, but a ley or soap, the last
of which however was not at that time known. But, to speak
the truth, potash and soda would not be altogether unfit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
washing; at any rate, not less fit than the <i>nether</i> or <i>nitrum</i>
there named. What may serve, however, to refute entirely
the opinion of Michaelis is, that no proof has yet been found
that soda is of so great antiquity. For my part, I am acquainted
with no older mention of it than that which occurs
in the works of the more modern Arabian physicians, Avicenna,
Serapio, and <span class="locked">others<a name="FNanchor_1241" id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a></span>.</p>

<p>All these grounds afford sufficient proof that the <i>nitrum</i> of
the ancients was our <i>natrum</i>, and not our saltpetre. But still,
in the account given by the ancients of that salt, there remain
many things inexplicable. Thus, for example, no one can
accurately define the epithets, <i>chalastricum</i>, <i>halmirhaga</i>,
<i>agrium</i>, <i>spuma nitri</i>, <i>aphronitrum</i>, and others, because they
do not indicate different kinds, as already said, but accidental
properties of the same salt. Without enlarging further on
this subject, I shall only remark that Pliny admits a natural
and an artificial kind of <i>nitrum</i>, and this division is adopted
by Serapio; but the latter term has not the meaning which
we affix to it at present. The ancients were acquainted with
no other than native <i>nitrum</i>, which they called artificial
only when it required a little more trouble and art to obtain
it.</p>

<p>Most of the physicians recommend red <i>nitrum</i>, which is
mentioned also by many of the modern travellers. When
Prosper Alpinus was in Egypt the rose-red <i>nitrum</i> cost twice
as much as the white. The red colour, in all probability, arises
from a metallic admixture; yet the red <i>nitrum</i> may be purer
than the other, as red or violet rock-salt is often clearer and
purer than that which is colourless.</p>

<p>One of the darkest parts in the history of <i>nitrum</i> is the following
passage of Pliny: “Faciunt ex his vasa, nec non frequenter
liquatum cum sulphure, coquentes in carbonibus.” The latter
words he seems soon after to repeat: “Sal nitrum sulphuri
concoctum in lapidem vertitur.” From these words J. <span class="locked">Rhodius<a name="FNanchor_1242" id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
concludes that <i>nitrum fixum</i> was at that time known, because
he considered <i>nitrum</i> to be saltpetre; but in that case
with the sulphur, Glaser’s sal polychrest must properly have
been produced. This, however, was not the case, because
<i>nitrum</i> was fixed alkali. The ancients therefore, when they
placed it with sulphur in a crucible upon burning coals must
have obtained liver of sulphur, which when it cools is hard,
but soon becomes moist when exposed to the air. But I will
not venture to determine whether anything of this kind is to
be supposed in Pliny, who did not himself fully understand
the subject on which he touches.</p>

<p>The account of vessels made of <i>nitrum</i> is still more singular.
Michaelis <span class="locked">conjectured<a name="FNanchor_1243" id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a></span> that articles of various kinds were cut
out of this substance, not for real use but merely for ornament,
in the same manner as similar things are cut out of rock-salt
in Transylvania, many specimens of which I have in my <span class="locked">collection<a name="FNanchor_1244" id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a></span>.
But even if <i>nitrum</i> had been compact and strong
enough for this purpose, there could not be the same inducement
to employ it as rock-salt, which, in consequence of its
solidity, transparency, brightness and smoothness, appears to
be capable of furnishing vessels equal to those made of the
most beautiful crystal. Dalechamp seems to explain the whole
as applicable to glazing; but in this case <i>nitrum</i> could serve
only as a flux.</p>

<p>Though it can be certainly proved that the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients
was an alkaline salt, it is difficult to determine the time
when our saltpetre was discovered or made known. As many
have conjectured that it was a component part of the Greek
fire, invented about the year 678, which, in all probability,
gave rise to the invention of gunpowder, I examined the prescriptions
for the preparation of it. The oldest, and perhaps
the most certain, is that given by the princess Anna Comnena;
in which however I find only resin, sulphur and oil, but
not saltpetre. <span class="locked">Klingenstierna<a name="FNanchor_1245" id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a></span> therefore judged very properly,
that all recipes in which saltpetre occurs are either
forged or of modern invention. Of this kind are those which
Scaliger, at least according to his own account, found in
Arabic works, and in which mention is made of <i>oleum de nitro</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
and <i>sal petræ</i><a name="FNanchor_1246" id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a>. But it does not occur in that prescription
given by Marcus Græcus, and copied by Albertus Magnus,
who died in <span class="locked">1280<a name="FNanchor_1247" id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a></span>.</p>

<p>I must still believe that the first certain mention of saltpetre
will be found in the oldest account of the preparation of
gunpowder, which, in my opinion, became known in Europe
in the thirteenth century, about the same time that the use of
the Greek fire, of which there were many kinds, began to be
lost. Among the oldest information on this subject is that
found in the above-quoted work of Albertus Magnus, and the
writings of Roger Bacon, who died in 1278. It is doubted
whether the first-mentioned treatise belongs to Albertus; but
it is certain that the author, whoever he may have been, and
also Bacon, both derived their information from the same
source.</p>

<p>When M. von Arretin lately announced that he was about
to publish a manuscript preserved in the electoral library at
Munich, which contained the true recipe for making the
Greek fire and the oldest for gunpowder, the same writing,
as appears, was printed from two manuscripts in the library
at Paris. I have now before me a copy of it, which was
transmitted to the library of our university by M. Laporte
Dutheil, conservateur des Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque<a name="FNanchor_1248" id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a>.</p>

<p>It contains many recipes, but only with a few variations,
as in Albertus Magnus; and it may be evidently seen that
Roger Bacon employed this writing, which is mentioned by
Jebb in the preface to his edition, from a copy preserved in
the library of Dr. Mead. Of this Marcus Græcus nothing at
present is known. According to some, he lived in the ninth
century; but others, with more probability, place him in the
thirteenth. Of his work, perhaps, we have only a translation;
for, from the surname Græcus, there is reason to think that
the original was written in the Greek language. I must,
however, remark that Cardan, where he gives directions for
making a fire which can be kindled by water, names Marcus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
Gracchus, but not Græcus. Scaliger, who, as is very probable,
had this writing also, makes no mention of it or its
author.</p>

<p>This Marcus speaks of saltpetre three times; first under
the name of <i>sal petrosum</i>, which occurs also in the same prescription
in Albertus Magnus; but the addition, which Albertus
does not repeat, is very remarkable. In my opinion, <i>scrophulæ
contra lapides</i> means the incrustation found on walls,
which was represented as a kind of leprosy. The addition of
ashes, or alkaline salts, the author either forgot or omitted,
because perhaps he did not consider it as indispensably necessary.
In another place it is said, <i>Lapis qui dicitur petra solis</i>,
or, as it is in other manuscripts, <i>salis</i>; but whether saltpetre
is here understood I will not venture to determine. In a
third passage we find the words <i>de sale petroso</i>, or <i>de salepetro</i>.</p>

<p>In the works of Bacon the term <i>sal petræ</i> occurs at least
three times. According to Casiri, the term <i>pulvis nitratus</i> is
to be found in an Arabic manuscript, the author of which
lived about the year <span class="locked">1249<a name="FNanchor_1249" id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a></span>. If the work of Geber, already
quoted, be genuine, and if this writer lived, as some think, in
the eighth century, it would be the oldest where saltpetre is
mentioned, in a prescription for an <i>aqua solutiva</i> or <i>dissolutiva</i>,
which almost seems to be aqua regia. I have not observed
the name <i>sal petræ</i> in the works of Vincent Bellovacensis,
who lived in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>In a word, I am more than ever inclined to accede to the
opinion of those who believe that gunpowder was invented in
India, and brought by the Saracens from Africa to the Europeans,
who however improved the preparation of it, and
found out different ways of employing it in war, as well as
small arms and <span class="locked">cannon<a name="FNanchor_1250" id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a></span>. In no country could saltpetre, and
the various uses of it, be more easily discovered than in India,
where the soil is so rich in nitrous particles that nothing is
necessary but to lixiviate it in order to obtain saltpetre; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
where this substance is so abundant, that almost all the gunpowder
used in the different wars with which the sovereigns
of Europe have tormented mankind was made from Indian
<span class="locked">saltpetre<a name="FNanchor_1251" id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a></span>. If it be true that saltpetre was not known in
Europe till the thirteenth century, neither gunpowder nor
aquafortis could have been made before that time; for the
former cannot be prepared without saltpetre, nor the latter
without nitre. But if it be true that this salt was known at
a much earlier period in India, it is not improbable that both
gunpowder and aquafortis were used by the Indians and the
Arabians before they were employed by the Europeans, especially
as the former were the first teachers of chemistry to the
latter. In my opinion, what I have already related proves
this in regard to gunpowder; and what I shall here add will
afford an equal proof in regard to aquafortis.</p>

<p>It is difficult to discover the first mention of mineral acids
in the writings of the ancient chemists. In the course of
their numerous experiments they obtained indeed, at an early
period, acids, the utility of which they extol; but each concealed
the process by which they were made; and as they
had no method of obtaining them pure, they were for a long
time unacquainted with the difference between the kinds.
Their prescriptions, when they are found, are so contradictory
and so carelessly written, that it is almost impossible to conjecture
which of the known acids forms the principal component
parts in their recipes or mixtures.</p>

<p>It appears to me, that the first intelligible account of aquafortis
occurs in the writings of the Arabians, or of the pupils
of Arabian chemists. At present I am acquainted with none
older than that to be found in the works of Geber. For
though I do not believe that those of which we have Latin
translations belong to a Geber of the eighth or ninth century,
I am ready to admit that they may be, at any rate, of the
twelfth. This appears probable, because about that period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
aquafortis and various arts are oftener mentioned, and in a
much clearer manner, in these writings.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted in the history of chemistry, that it is
impossible to determine the period of the Greek chemist or
alchemist known under the name of Synesius; but it cannot
be doubted that he borrowed a great deal from the works of
the Arabians. This Synesius, among the chemical solvents,
mentions water of saltpetre, which might be considered as
<span class="locked">aquafortis<a name="FNanchor_1252" id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a></span>. But, as he mentions at the same time <i>aqua fæcis</i>,
he appears to me to allude to the <i>nitrum</i> of the ancients, not
to our saltpetre, and in general to strong alkaline leys, which
indeed are capable of dissolving many bodies.</p>

<p>The monk Theophilus, of whom I have already spoken,
and who in all probability lived in the twelfth century, appears
also to have been acquainted with aquafortis; for in
some of the passages quoted from his works by <span class="locked">Raspe<a name="FNanchor_1253" id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a></span>, he
speaks of an acid which dissolved all metals. In the writings
of Vincent Bellovacensis, in the thirteenth century, some
traces, but very doubtful, are found of aquafortis. Where
he mentions the different sorts of gold he speaks of dissolving
it, but by this expression he does not allude to its treatment
with fire, which he speaks of <span class="locked">separately<a name="FNanchor_1254" id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a></span>. In another place
he mentions the different solvents, and among these names
vegetable acids, a water of sal-ammoniac, and a water obtained
from alum by distillation. He here means undoubtedly
a mineral <span class="locked">acid<a name="FNanchor_1255" id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a></span>. Michael Meier, the most learned chemist
of the seventeenth century, says that Vincentius speaks
of aquafortis as of a secret; but the passage I have not yet
been able to <span class="locked">find<a name="FNanchor_1256" id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a></span>.</p>

<p>Spielman states that Lullius, who died in 1315, in the
eightieth year of his age, gave an account of his obtaining
aquafortis from saltpetre by the addition of vitriol, and that
Basilius Valentin was acquainted with the use of clay for the
same purpose. Picus Mirandula however declares it to be
uncertain whether Arnoldus de Villa Nova was acquainted
with the acid of saltpetre in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
It appears to be an old tradition that this acid was first
employed at Venice, by some Germans, for separating the
noble metals, and conveyed thence as an article of merchandize
to every part of Europe. The persons who prepared it
were there narrowly watched, in order that the process might
not become known. They were employed chiefly for separating
the gold from the Spanish silver, and by these means
acquired great riches. Hence arose the report that the
people of Venice understood the art of making gold; and it
is certain that in many countries the gold refiners were for a
long time considered as gold makers; but in no period were
there more gold makers than in that when separation in the
moist way became known. I can however give less account
of this art of the Venetians than of the introduction of it into
France in the fifteenth or the beginning of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>William Budæus, who was born in 1467, and died in 1540,
speaks of it in his book, printed for the first time in 1516, as
a thing entirely new at that <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_1257" id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a></span>. A man of low extraction,
named Le Cointe, first undertook to separate gold
from silver at Paris, by means of a water which Budæus calls
<i>aqua chrysulca</i>. It is very remarkable, that by means of this
water he could separate the smallest particle of gold from
silver, and from every other metal; nay, he could even take
from vessels their gilding without altering their form. By
this art he acquired great wealth; which together with his
secret descended to his son, who at the time was the only
gold refiner at Paris.</p>

<p>He adds, that the art was exceedingly dangerous as well
as unhealthy, and required great precaution. The possessor
of it, when he became rich, left the execution of the work to
a servant, whom he directed at a distance, that he might not
expose himself to the pernicious fumes of the effervescing
liquor. The fumes of the acid derived from saltpetre are
indeed prejudicial to the health; but the danger has been
much exaggerated, and no doubt with a view to deter people
from attempting to discover the art, and to furnish a pretence
for raising the price of the <span class="locked">production<a name="FNanchor_1258" id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
Budæus relates also, that the gold was left behind undissolved.
The silver only was dissolved, and by another art
was separated from the water and washed. It may here be
easily perceived that Le Cointe employed aquafortis; but if
he was able to loosen the gold from gilt vessels without destroying
them, he must have used aqua regia, which consequently
was not then unknown.</p>

<p>From other information, it appears that the mint at Paris
purchased the art from Le Cointe’s son, but still kept it a
secret. On this account Francis I., by a decree issued at
Blois on the 19th of March 1540, authorized the raising the
value of coin, in order to defray the expense of fuel and
assaying-water. In the middle of the seventeenth century,
the preparation of aquafortis and the process of assaying in
the moist way were fully known in France. At any rate, in
the month of January 1637, the distillers obtained a guild
letter, in which aquafortis is mentioned among the articles
sold by them.</p>

<p>When saltpetre became necessary to governments for the
manufacture of gunpowder, they endeavoured to obtain it at
as cheap a rate as possible. No one before suspected that
rulers would be justified in exclusively carrying away the incrustation
of walls from private houses, which, when it could
be used, became <i>accessorium fundi</i>. But the idea of regalia,
so often abused, was extended so wide under various pretences,
that the saltpetre regale and the letting of it was one
of the severest oppressions to which the people were exposed
by their rulers, and which occasioned almost as bitter complaints
as the hunting regale, founded on no better grounds.
I shall not here attempt to delineate the sufferings which were
thus occasioned in many countries; they are still fresh in
remembrance.</p>

<p>The oldest mention of this hated regale which I myself
have found is of the year 1419. At that time, Gunther,
archbishop of Magdeburg, granted to some person the right
of searching out saltpetre and boiling it, during a year, in the
district of Gibichenstein, for which he was to pay a barrel of
saltpetre, and deliver to the archbishop the remainder at the
rate of five cross-groschens per pound. The succeeding
archbishop, Frederick, let in the year 1460, to a burgher of
Halle, all the earth and the saltpetre that could be collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
from it in the bailiwick of Gibichenstein, for four years, at
the annual rent of a barrel of good refined saltpetre. On the
same conditions, bishop Ernest, in 1477, let to some one for
his lifetime the collection of the saltpetre. In 1544, a certain
person obtained the collection of saltpetre from two
heaps of rubbish before the gates at Halle. The magistrates
of Halle also in 1545 had a saltpetre-work and a powder-mill.
In the year 1560, John VI., archbishop of Triers, gave to
some one permission to search for and dig up saltpetre. In
1583, the saltpetre regale was confirmed by a Brandenburg
decree as a thing long known, and the case was the same
with a Hessian of the year 1589.</p>

<p>It is very probable that this example was soon followed by
most sovereigns; but even if they had collected and scraped
together the nitrous incrustation of all the walls in Europe,
they certainly would not have found a quantity of saltpetre
sufficient for the gunpowder used in the numerous wars
which took place, had not a much greater supply been obtained
from India, and particularly from Patna. I do not
know whether the Portuguese brought this article to Europe;
but that it was imported at a very early period by the Dutch
is proved by the oldest ladings of their return ships; and
they at length found means to appropriate this branch of
trade so entirely to themselves, that the other Europeans for
a long time could not obtain any saltpetre in India.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, when chemistry began to be
studied with more care and attention in Europe, and particularly
in Germany, and the component parts and production
of saltpetre became better known, many conceived the
idea of improving the methods of obtaining it in Europe so
much, that it might be possible to dispense with the Indian
saltpetre, and flattered themselves with the hopes of thence
deriving great advantages. Some proposed to fill tubes with
putrifiable substances and earth capable of fixing of the nitric
acid; others preferred building vaults of these substances, and
Glauber recommended the filling of pits with them. The
proposal, however, which met with the greatest approbation
was that of building walls of them. Through a confidence
in this idea, towns and villages were compelled to erect and
maintain a certain number of saltpetre walls, under the most
gracious promise that the collectors of saltpetre should no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
longer be allowed to spoil private dwellings, or render them
unhealthful.</p>

<p>But experience has shown that all the means and coercive
measures hitherto employed have rendered the European saltpetre
much dearer than that obtained by commerce from
Bengal. This will be readily comprehended, when it is
known that earth richly impregnated with saltpetre abounds
in India, and that it may be extracted by lixiviation without
any addition, and brought to crystallize in that warm climate
without the aid of fire; that the price of labour there is exceedingly
low; that this salt is brought from India instead
of ballast by all the commercial nations of Europe, where the
competition of the sellers prevents the price from ever being
extravagantly high, while the preparation of it in Europe, in
consequence of the still increasing price of labour, fuel and
ashes, is always becoming dearer. This regale will at length
be everywhere scouted. In the duchy of Wurtemberg and
the Prussian states, where it was most rigidly enforced, in
consequence of an urgent representation from the States it
was abolished in 1798; but in both countries an indemnification
was given to government for the loss. The case also
has been the same in <span class="locked">Sweden<a name="FNanchor_1259" id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a></span>. In the duchy of Brunswick
it was soon suffered to drop; but in the electoral dominions
it never was introduced.</p>

<p>[The greater part of our nitre is derived from Bengal,
where, as in Egypt, Persia, Spain, &amp;c., it exists in the soil.
It is separated by lixiviation and crystallization. In France,
Sweden and some other countries it is prepared artificially in
nitre-beds. These are formed of various animal matters,
mixed with lime or mortar-rubbish; the mixture is watered
and stirred occasionally, and allowed to remain for
a considerable time. The whole is then lixiviated and decomposed
by carbonate of potash. The nitre is then separated
and purified by crystallization. In some cases wood-ashes
are mixed with the animal matters; the decomposition
with potash is then unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
It is a question whether the nitric acid in the nitre arises
from the nitrogen of the atmosphere or that in the animal
matters. Dr. Davy has found nitre in a cave at Ceylon,
where no nitrogenous matter was present; and in some parts
of India, Spain, and some other countries, at a distance from
all habitations, immense quantities of nitre are reproduced in
soils which have been washed the year before. Nitre is
directly brought into this country from Calcutta and Madras,
in bags containing from 150 lbs. to 175 lbs. each. From
200,000 cwts. to 260,000 cwts. are annually imported into
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In making gunpowder, the components, the sulphur, nitre,
and charcoal should be as pure as possible, and reduced to
the finest possible powder; they are sifted and mixed in
the proper proportions. The mixture is then made into a
cake with water, and ground between calcareous millstones.
It is then granulated through sieves in another mill, and
again sifted. It is then polished and hardened by revolving
rapidly in a cask, and finally dried. The proportions of
the constituents vary in different countries; at Waltham
Abbey they are seventy-five nitre, fifteen charcoal and ten
sulphur. The quantity of gunpowder consumed in this country
is enormous; moreover, 4,000,000 lbs. are annually exported,
the greater part of which is sent to the western coast
of Africa.</p>

<p>The force of the explosion of gunpowder is owing to the
sudden disengagement of gaseous products; these consist of
nitrogen, carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, and sulphurous acid
gases; and their volume has been calculated to amount to
2000 times the bulk of the powder.]</p>

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1198" id="Footnote_1198" href="#FNanchor_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a> The passage of Jerome relating to Proverbs, xxv. 20, I here insert
entire, because I shall often have occasion to employ it:&mdash;“Nitrum a
Nitria provincia, ubi maxime nasci solet, nomen accepit. Nee multum a
salis Ammoniaci specie distat. Nam sicut salem in litore maris fervor
solis conficit, durando in petram aquas marinas, quas major vis ventorum,
vel ipsius maris fervor in litoris ulteriora projecerit; ita in Nitria, ubi
æstate pluviæ prolixiores tellurem infundunt, adest ardor sideris tantus,
quod ipsas aquas pluviales per latitudinem arenarum concoquat in petram;
salis quidem vel glaciei aspectui simillimam; sed nil gelidi rigoris, nil
salsi saporis habentem, quæ tamen, juxta naturam salis, in caumate durare,
et in nubilos, aere fluere ac liquefieri solet. Hanc indigenæ sumentes
servant, et ubi opus extiterit, pro lomento utuntur. Unde Judæo
peccanti dicit propheta Jeremias: Si laveris te nitro, et multiplicaveris
tibi herbam borith, maculata es in iniquitate tua, dicit Dominus Deus.
Crepitat autem in aqua quomodo calx viva; et ipsum quidem disperit,
sed aquam lavationi habilem reddit; cujus natura cui sit apta figuræ, cernens
Solomon ait: Acetum in nitro, qui cantat carmina cordi pessimo.
Acetum quippe si mittatur in nitrum, protinus ebullit.”</p></div>

<h2 id="book">BOOK-CENSORS.</h2>

<p>“On account of the great ease,” says M. Putter, “with
which, after the invention of printing, copies of books could
be multiplied and dispersed, it was necessary that some means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
should be devised to prevent a bad use from being made of
this art, and to guard against its being employed to the prejudice
of either religion or good morals, or to the injury of
states. For this reason it was everywhere laid down as a
general maxim, that no one should be allowed to establish a
printing office at pleasure, but by the permission and under
the inspection of government; and that no work should be
suffered to go to press until it had been examined by a censor
appointed for that purpose, or declared by a particular order
to be of a harmless <span class="locked">nature<a name="FNanchor_1260" id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Many centuries however before the invention of printing,
books were forbidden by different governments, and even
condemned to the flames. A variety of proofs can be produced
that this was the case among both the ancient Greeks
and Romans. At Athens the works of Protagoras were prohibited;
and all the copies of them which could be collected
were burnt by the public <span class="locked">crier<a name="FNanchor_1261" id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a></span>. At Rome the writings of
Numa, which had been found in his grave, were, by order of
the senate, condemned to the fire, because they were contrary
to the religion which he had <span class="locked">introduced<a name="FNanchor_1262" id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a></span>. As the
populace at Rome were, in times of public calamity, more
addicted to superstition than seemed proper to the government,
an order was issued that all superstitious and astrological
books should be delivered into the hands of the prætor.
This order was often repeated; and the emperor Augustus
caused more than two thousand of these books to be burnt
at one <span class="locked">time<a name="FNanchor_1263" id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a></span>. Under the same emperor the satirical works
of Labienus were condemned to the fire, which was the first
instance of this nature; and it is related as something singular,
that a few years after the writings of the person who
had been the cause of the order for that purpose shared the
like fate, and were also publicly <span class="locked">burnt<a name="FNanchor_1264" id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a></span>. (In a manner somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
similar the works of Ben. Arias Montanus, who assisted
to make the first catalogue of prohibited books in the
Netherlands, were afterwards inserted in a catalogue of the
same kind). The burning of these works having induced
Cassius Severus to say, in a sneering manner, that it would
be necessary to burn him alive, as he had got by heart the
writings of his friend Labienus, this expression gave rise to a
law of Augustus against abusive <span class="locked">writings<a name="FNanchor_1265" id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a></span>. When Cremutius
Cordus, in his History, called C. Cassius the last of the
Romans, the senate, in order to flatter Tiberius, caused the
book to be burnt; but a number of copies were saved by
being <span class="locked">concealed<a name="FNanchor_1266" id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a></span>. Antiochus Epiphanes caused the books
of the Jews to be <span class="locked">burnt<a name="FNanchor_1267" id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a></span>; and in the first centuries of our
æra the books of the Christians were treated with equal severity,
of which Arnobius bitterly <span class="locked">complains<a name="FNanchor_1268" id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a></span>. We are told
by Eusebius, that Diocletian caused the sacred Scriptures to
be <span class="locked">burnt<a name="FNanchor_1269" id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a></span>. After the spreading of the Christian religion the
clergy exercised against books that were either unfavourable
or disagreeable to them, the same severity which they had
censured in the heathens as foolish and prejudicial to their
own cause. Thus were the writings of Arius condemned to
the flames at the council of Nice; and Constantine threatened
with the punishment of death those who should conceal <span class="locked">them<a name="FNanchor_1270" id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a></span>.
The clergy assembled at the council of Ephesus requested
the emperor Theodosius II. to cause the works of Nestorius
to be burnt; and this desire was complied <span class="locked">with<a name="FNanchor_1271" id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a></span>. The
writings of Eutyches shared the like fate at the council of
Chalcedon; and it would not be difficult to collect examples
of the same kind from each of the following centuries.</p>

<p>We have instances also that, many centuries prior to the
invention of printing, authors submitted their works, before
they were published, to the judgement of their superiors.
This was done principally by the clergy; partly to secure
themselves from censure or punishment, and partly to show
their respect to the pope or to bishops. It however does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
appear that this was a duty, but a voluntary act. In the
year 768, Ambrosius Autpert, a Benedictine monk, sent his
Exposition of the book of Revelation to Pope Stephen III.,
and begged that he would publish the work and make it
known. On this occasion he says expressly, that he is the
first writer who ever requested such a favour; that liberty to
write belongs to every one who does not wish to depart from
the doctrine of the fathers of the church; and he hopes that
this freedom will not be lessened on account of his voluntary
<span class="locked">submission<a name="FNanchor_1272" id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a></span>.</p>

<p>Soon after the invention of printing, laws began to be made
for subjecting books to examination; a regulation proposed
even by Plato, and which has been wished for by many
since. It is very probable that the fear under which the
clergy were, lest publications should get abroad prejudicial
to religion, and consequently to their power, contributed not
a little to hasten the establishment of book-censors. The
earliest instance of a book printed with a permission from
government, is commonly supposed to occur in the year 1480;
and Dom Liron, a Benedictine monk, is perhaps the first person
who made that remark. He is the author of a work called
Singularités Historiques et <span class="locked">Litteraires<a name="FNanchor_1273" id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a></span>; in the last part of
which, where he speaks of the Heidelberg edition of the book
Nosce te ipsum, in 1480, he says, “This is the first publication
I found accompanied with several solemn approbations
and attestations in its favour.” The same thing is said by
J. N. Weislinger, one of the most illiberal defenders of the
Catholic church, in whose work, entitled Armamentarium
<span class="locked">Catholicum<a name="FNanchor_1274" id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a></span>, there is an account of that book. He there
tells us in Latin, without mentioning Liron, “This is the first
book which I have seen, subjected to the examination, reading,
and approbation of the clergy;” and in the opinion of Mercier,
it really is the oldest. It has four approbations (in Latin);
the first and last of which I shall here insert (in English), as
they will serve to show the foolish pride of the clergy at that
period:&mdash;“I Philip Rota, doctor of laws, <i>though the least of
all</i>, have read over carefully, and diligently examined, this
small work, Nosce te; and as I have found it not only composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
devoutly and catholically, but abounding also with
matter of wonderful utility, I do not hesitate, in testimony of
the above, to subscribe my name.... I Mapheus Girardo, by
the divine mercy patriarch of Venice and primate of Dalmatia,
confiding in the fidelity of the above gentlemen, who have
examined and approved the above-mentioned book, do testify
that it is a devout and orthodox work.” There were, therefore,
censors at this early period who gave their opinion of
books without reading them.</p>

<p>I should have considered these instances as the oldest information
respecting book-censors, had I not been induced
by M. Eccard, the learned amanuensis belonging to our library,
to look into the Literary Weekly Journal of Cologne,
for the year 1778. In that work I found an ingenious account,
by an anonymous author, of the early state of printing in that
city, and of two books printed almost a year sooner than 1479,
with the approbation of the public censor. The first is Wilhelmi
episcopi Lugdunensis Summa de Virtutibus; at the
end of which are the following words:&mdash;“Benedictus sit dominus
virtutum, qui hoc opus earundem felici consummatione
terminari dedit in laudabili civitate Coloniensi, temptatum,
<i>admissumque et approbatum ab alma universitate studii</i> civitatis
praedictae, <i>de consensu et voluntate</i> spectabilis et egregii viri
pro tempore recteris ejusdem, impressum per Henr. Quentel.”
The other book is a Bible, with the following conclusion:&mdash;“Anno
incarnationis dominice millesimo quadringentesimo
<span class="smcap smaller">LXXIX</span> ipsa vigilia Matthaei apostoli. Quando insigne veteris
novique testamenti opus cum canonibus evangelistarum et
eorum concordantiis in laudem et gloriam sancte et individue
trinitatis intemerateque virginis Marie impressum in Civitate
Coloniensi per Conradum de Homborch, <i>admissum</i>, <i>approbatum</i>
ab alma universitate Coloniensi.”</p>

<p>The oldest mandate for appointing a book-censor is, as far
as I know at present, that issued by Berthold, archbishop of
Mentz, in the year 1486, and which may be found in the
fourth volume of Guden’s Codex <span class="locked">Diplomaticus<a name="FNanchor_1275" id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the year 1501, pope Alexander VI. published a bull,
the first part of which may form an excellent companion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
the mandate of the archbishop of <span class="locked">Mentz<a name="FNanchor_1276" id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a></span>. After some complaints
against the devil, who sows tares among the wheat,
his holiness proceeds thus: “Having been informed, that by
means of the said art many books and treatises containing
various errors and pernicious doctrines, even hostile to the
holy Christian religion, have been printed, and are still printed
in various parts of the world, particularly in the provinces of
Cologne, Mentz, Triers, and Magdeburg; and being desirous,
without further delay, to put a stop to this detestable evil ...
we, by these presents, and by authority of the Apostolic
chamber, strictly forbid all printers, their servants, and those
exercising the art of printing under them, in any manner
whatsoever, in the abovesaid provinces, under pain of excommunication,
and a pecuniary fine, to be imposed and exacted
by our venerable brethren the archbishops of Cologne,
Mentz, Triers, and Magdeburg, and their vicars-general or
official in spirituals, according to the pleasure of each in his
own province, to print hereafter any books, treatises, or
writings, until they have consulted on this subject the archbishops,
vicars, or officials above-mentioned, and obtained
their special and express licence, to be granted free of all expense,
whose consciences we charge, that before they grant
any licence of this kind, they will carefully examine, or cause
to be examined, by able and catholic persons, the works to be
printed; and that they will take the utmost care that nothing
may be printed wicked and scandalous, or contrary to the
orthodox faith.” The rest of the bull contains regulations
to prevent works already printed from doing mischief. All
catalogues and books printed before that period were to be
examined, and those which contained anything prejudicial to
the Catholic religion were to be burned.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the sixteenth century, it was ordered
by the well-known council of the Lateran, held at Rome in
the year 1515, that in future no books should be printed but
such as had been inspected by ecclesiastical censors.</p>

<p>In France, the faculty of Theology usurped, as some say,
the right of censuring books; but in the year 1650, when
public censors, whom the faculty opposed, were appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
without their consent, they stated the antiquity of their right
to be two hundred years. For they said, “It is above two
hundred years since the doctors of Paris have had a right to
approve books without being subjected but to their own faculty,
to which they assert they are alone responsible for their
<span class="locked">decisions<a name="FNanchor_1277" id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a></span>.”</p>

<p>[In no country of Europe does the liberty of the press
prevail to such an extent as with us, the only vestige of censorship
being the censor for the drama. In Rome the same
strictness prevails as ever, but a brighter day seems dawning.
In Germany the censorship is excessively severe, especially in
Austria, Bavaria, and Prussia. However, most of the prohibited
works are printed in Switzerland, Hamburg, or Leipsig,
and there being a very large demand for such works, they
may be had of almost any bookseller in every principal town.
To put a stop to this, the present monarch of Prussia, <i>professedly</i>
a liberal, placed under ban all the works issued by
the firm of Hoffmann and Campe of Hamburg, because they
published the political poems of Hoffmann von Fallersleben.
Caricatures are, as the reader may suppose, subject to as strict
a law, and no H.B. could be tolerated there.]</p>

<h2 id="exclusive">EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGE FOR PRINTING BOOKS.</h2>

<p>I do not mean in this article to give a complete catalogue of
all the books printed under a privilege in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, for such a list would be attended with
very little utility. All I wish is to contribute something towards
answering the question, What are the oldest privileges
granted to books?</p>

<p>The oldest known at present is that granted in the year
1490, by Henry bishop of Bamberg, to the following book:
Liber Missalis secundum ordinem ecclesiæ Bambergensis&mdash;Anno
incarnationis dominice <span class="smcap smaller">MCCCCXC.</span> nono vero kal. April.&mdash;In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
civitate Babenbergn. per magistrum Johannem Sensenschmidt,
prefate civitatis incolam, et Heinr. Petzensteiner.
This privilege was first noticed by Panzer, in his History of
the Nuremberg editions of the Bible, and afterwards by Mr.
Am Ende, in Meusel’s Collection for enlarging Historical
Knowledge. The latter says, “One may readily believe that
this bishop was not the inventor of such privileges, and that
they are consequently of much greater antiquity than has
hitherto been supposed.” Mr. Am Ende mentions also a
privilege of the year 1491, to a work called Hortus Sanitatis,
typis Iacobi Meydenbach.... Impressum autem est hoc
ipsum in incl. civ. Moguntina ... sub Archipraesulatu rever.
et benigniss. principis et D. D. Bertholdi, archiep. Moguntinensis
ac princ. elector. cujus felicissimo auspicio graditur,
recipitur et auctorisatur. This, says Mr. Am Ende, may
allude to a privilege, and perhaps not. For my part, I conjecture
that it refers only to a permission to print, granted in
consequence of the institution of book-censors by the archbishop
Berthold, in the year 1486.</p>

<p>The oldest Venetian privilege at present known, is of the
year 1491, found by M. Pütter to the following work: Foenix
Magistri Petri memoriae Ravennatis. The Colophon is Bernardinus
de Choris de Cremona impressor delectus impressit.
Venetias die X Ianuarii <span class="smcap smaller">MCCCCXCI.</span> The book is in quarto,
and has the privilege on both the last pages. There is a
Venetian privilege also of the year 1492, to Senecæ Tragediæ
cum commento.... Cum privilegio ne quis audeat hoc opus
cum hoc commento imprimere, sub pena in eo contenta,
Venetiis per Lazarum Issarda de Saliviano 1492, die XII.
Decembris.</p>

<p>The oldest Papal privilege hitherto known is of the year
1505, to Hervei Britonis in IV Petri Lombardi Sententiarum
volumina, scripta subtilissima.</p>

<p>In the year 1495, Aldus published the works of Aristotle,
at the end of the first part of which we find the following
notice: “Concessum est eidem Aldo inventori ab illustrissimo
senatu Veneto, ne quis queat imprimere neque hunc
librum, neque caeteros quos is ipse impresserit; neque ejus uti
invento.” The last words allude to the Greek types which
were employed in printing the Aldine editions of the Greek
classics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
The following among other early privileges are quoted by
Pütter<a name="FNanchor_1278" id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> and <span class="locked">Hoffmann<a name="FNanchor_1279" id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="hang2">

<p>1495. A Milanese, by duke Louis Sforza, to Michael Ferner
and Eustachius Silber for I. A. Campani Opera.</p>

<p>1501. Privilegium sodalitatis Celticæ a senatu Romani imperii
impetratum, to Conrade Celtes’ edition of the works
of Hroswitha.</p>

<p>1506. A papal, of pope Julius II., to Evangelista Tosino the
bookseller, for Ptolomaei Geographia.</p>

<p>1507. A French, of Louis XII. to Antoine Verard.</p>

abbatis antiqui.</p>

<p>1512. An Imperial, to Rosslin’s Swangere Frauwen Rosegarten.</p>

<p>1527. A privilege from the duke of Saxony to the edition of
the New Testament by Emser.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anderson remarks on the year 1590, that the first exclusive
patent, for printing a book in England, which occurs in
Rymer’s Fœdera<a name="FNanchor_1280" id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a>, was granted in the above year by queen
Elizabeth, to Richard Weight of Oxford, for a Translation
of Tacitus. I am much astonished that Anderson, who was
so often obliged to use Rymer’s Fœdera, and who seems
indeed to have consulted it with attention, should have overlooked
the oldest patents which are to be found in that collection.
In that laborious work, so important to those who
wish to be acquainted with the history of British literature,
Ames’ Typographical Antiquities, there are privileges of still
greater antiquity. The oldest which I observed in this work
are the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote class="hang2">

<p>1510. The history of king Boccus ... printed at London
by Thomas Godfry. Cum privilegio regali.</p>

<p>1518. Oratio Richardi Pacei ... Impressa per Richardum
Pynson, regium impressorem, cum privilegio a rege
indulto, ne quis hanc orationem intra biennium in
regno Angliæ imprimat, aut alibi impressam et importatam
in eodem regno Angliæ vendat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other works printed <i>cum gratia et privilegio</i> occur 1520,
1521, 1525, 1528, 1530, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the year 1483, when the well-known act was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
against foreign merchants, foreigners however were permitted
to import books and manuscripts, and also to print them in
the kingdom; but this liberty was afterwards revoked by
Henry VIII., in the year 1533, by an order which may be
found in Ames. In 1538, Henry issued an order respecting
the printing of bibles; and in 1542, he gave a bookseller an
exclusive privilege during four years for that <span class="locked">purpose<a name="FNanchor_1281" id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
With a view of finding the oldest Spanish privilege, I consulted
a variety of works, and among others Specimen Bibliothecae
Hispano-Majansianae, but I met with none older
than that to the following book: Aelii Antonii Nebrissensis Introductiones
in Latinam Grammaticen. Logronii Cantabrorum
Vasconum urbe nobilissima; anno salutis millesimo quingentesimo
decimo. fol. That privileges to books were usual in
Poland, has been shown by Am Ende, in Meusel’s Collections
before-mentioned.</p>

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1281" id="Footnote_1281" href="#FNanchor_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> [Exclusive privileges for printing the English Bible and Prayer have
been granted by the Crown at different periods up to the present time, with
the exception of the period of the Commonwealth, during which they were
abolished. In the 27th year of Charles II. a Royal patent was granted to
Thomas Newcomb and Henry Hills. In the 12th of Anne to Benjamin
Tooke and John Barber; in the 22nd of George I. to John Basket. Then
came John Reeves, who received his patent from George III. in the 39th
year of his reign, and in association with George Eyre and Andrew Strahan,
printed the many editions of the Bible and Prayer described as Reeves’
editions. The present patent was conferred by George IV. upon Andrew
Strahan, George Eyre, and Andrew Spottiswoode, for a term of thirty
years, which commenced January 21, 1830, and consequently ceases in
1860. By this last patent every one but the patentees is prohibited from
printing in England any Bible or New Testament in the English tongue,
of any translation, with or without notes; or any Prayers, Rites, or Ceremonies
of the United Church of England and Ireland; or any books commanded
to be used by the Crown; nor can either of the above be imported
from abroad, if printed in English, or in English mixed with any other
tongue. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge also enjoy the right of
printing Bibles, &amp;c., in common with the patentees; but in their case it is
a simple affair of permission, they having no power to prohibit or prosecute.
The present patentees, it may be here observed, have not of late years
attempted to enforce their rights, and Bibles are now printed almost <i>ad
libitum</i>.
</p>
<p>
In Scotland, prior to 1700, various persons held concurrent licenses,
consequently it is very difficult to say who were king’s printers and who
were not. On July 6, 1716, George I. granted a patent to John Basket,
the English patentee, and Agnes Campbell, jointly for forty-one years. To
them succeeded Alexander Kincaird, whose patent dates from June 21,
1749; and then James Hunter Blair and John Bruce, whose patent commenced
in 1798 and expired in the hands of their heirs, Sir D. H. Blair
and Miss Bruce. In 1833 the patent ceased, and has never been renewed.
Unlike either England or Ireland, the four Scotch Universities have never
participated in this monopoly.
</p>
<p>
In Ireland, George III. in 1766 granted a Bible patent to Boulter Grierson
for forty years. He was succeeded by his son George Grierson, who, in
1811, obtained a renewal, and is still with Mr. Keene, the Irish patentee.
Trinity College, Dublin, has also a concurrent right, but both Oxford and
Cambridge are, by the Irish printers’ own patent, permitted to import their
Bibles into Ireland.&mdash;<i>Dr. Campbell’s Letters on the Bible Monopoly.</i>]</p></div>

<h2 id="catalogues">CATALOGUES OF BOOKS.</h2>

<p>The first printers printed books at their own expense, and
sold them themselves. It was necessary therefore that they
should have large capitals. Paper and all other materials, as
well as labour, were in the infancy of the art exceedingly
dear for those periods; and on the other hand the purchasers
of books were few, partly because the price of them was too
high, and partly because, knowledge being less widely diffused,
they were not so generally read as at present. For these
reasons many of the principal printers, notwithstanding their
learning and ingenuity, became <span class="locked">poor<a name="FNanchor_1282" id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a></span>. In this manner my
countrymen Conrade Sweynheim and Arnold Pannarz, who
were the first, and for a long time the only printers at Rome,
a city which on many accounts, particularly in the sixteenth
century, might be called the first in Christendom, were
obliged, after the number of the volumes in their warehouses
amounted to 12,475, to solicit support from the <span class="locked">pope<a name="FNanchor_1283" id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a></span>. In
the course of time this profession was divided, and there arose
booksellers. It appears that the printers themselves first gave
up the bookselling part of the business, and retained only
that of printing; at least this is said to have been the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
with that well-known bookseller John Rainmann, who was
born at Oehringen, and resided at <span class="locked">Augsburg<a name="FNanchor_1284" id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a></span>. He was at
first a printer and letter-founder, and from him Aldus purchased
his types. Books of his printing may be found from
the year 1508 to 1524; and in many he is styled the celebrated
German bookseller. About the same period lived the
booksellers Jos. Burglin and George Diemar. Sometimes
there were rich people of all conditions, particularly eminent
merchants, who caused books which they sold to be printed
at their own expense. In this manner that learned man Henry
Stephens was printer at Paris to Ulric Fugger at Augsburg,
from whom he received a salary for printing the many manuscripts
which he purchased. In some editions, from the year
1558 to 1567, he subscribes himself Henricus Stephanus, illustris
viri Hulderici Fuggeri typographus. In the like manner
also, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, a society
of learned and rich citizens of Augsburg, at the head of whom
was Marx Welser, the city-steward, printed a great number
of books, which had commonly at the end these words, <i>ad
insigne pinus</i>. Printing therefore thus gave rise to a new
and important branch of trade, that of bookselling, which was
established in Germany, chiefly at Frankfort on the Maine,
where, particularly at the time of the fairs, there were several
large bookseller’s shops in that street which still retains the
name of <i>Book-street</i>.</p>

<p>George Willer, whom some improperly call Viller, and
others Walter, a bookseller at Augsburg, who kept a very
large shop, and frequented the Frankfort fairs, first fell upon
the plan of publishing every fair a catalogue of all the new
books, adding the size, and publishing names. Le Mire,
better known under the name of Miræus<a name="FNanchor_1285" id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a>, says, that catalogues
were first printed in the year 1554; but <span class="locked">Labbe<a name="FNanchor_1286" id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a></span>,
<span class="locked">Reimann<a name="FNanchor_1287" id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a></span>, and <span class="locked">Heumann<a name="FNanchor_1288" id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a></span>, who took their information from
Le Mire, make the year, perhaps erroneously, to be 1564.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
Willer’s catalogues were printed till the year 1592, by Nicol.
Bassæus, printer at Frankfort. Other booksellers however
must have soon published catalogues of the like kind, though
that of Willer continued a long time to be the <span class="locked">principal<a name="FNanchor_1289" id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a></span>.</p>

<p>In all these catalogues, which are in quarto, and not paged,
the following order is observed. The Latin books occupy
the first place, beginning with the Protestant theological
works, perhaps because Willer was a Lutheran; then come
the Catholic; and after these, books of jurisprudence, medicine,
philosophy, poetry, and music. The second place is
assigned to German books, which are arranged in the same
manner.</p>

<p>In the year 1604, the general Easter Catalogue was printed
with a permission from government.</p>

<p>After this the Leipsic booksellers began not only to reprint
the Frankfort catalogues, but to enlarge them with many
books which had not been brought to the fairs in that city.
I have, dated 1600, a catalogue of all the books on sale in
Book-street, Frankfort, and also of the books published at
Leipsic, which have not been brought to Frankfort; with
the permission of his highness the elector of Saxony to those
new works which have appeared at Leipsic. Printed at
Leipsic, by Abraham Lamberg; and to be had at his shop.
On the September catalogue of the same year, it is said that
it is printed from the Frankfort copy, with additions. I find
an imperial privilege, for the first time, on the Frankfort
September catalogue of 1616. Some imperial permissions
however may be of an earlier date; for I have not seen a
complete series of these catalogues.</p>

<p>Reimmann says that, after Willer’s death, the catalogue
was published by the Leipsic bookseller Henning Grosse, and
by his son and grandson. The council of Frankfort caused
several regulations to be issued respecting catalogues, an
account of which may be seen in Orth’s work on the Imperial
Fairs at <span class="locked">Frankfort<a name="FNanchor_1290" id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a></span>. After the business of bookselling
was drawn from Frankfort to Leipsic, occasioned principally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
by the restrictions to which it was subjected at the former by
the censors, no more catalogues were printed there; and the
shops in Book-street were gradually converted into taverns.</p>

<p>In perusing these old catalogues one cannot help being
astonished at the sudden and great increase of books; and when
one reflects that a great many of them no longer exist, this
perishableness of human labours will excite the same sensations
as those which arise in the mind when one reads in a
church-yard the names and titles of persons long since mouldered
into dust. In the sixteenth century there were few libraries;
and these, which did not contain many books, were
in monasteries, and consisted principally of theological, philosophical
and historical works, with a few however on jurisprudence
and medicine; while those which treated of agriculture,
manufactures and trade, were thought unworthy of
the notice of the learned, and of being preserved in large
collections. The number of these works was, nevertheless,
far from being inconsiderable; and at any rate many of them
would have been of great use, as they would have served to
illustrate the instructive history of the arts. Catalogues which
might have given occasion to inquiries after books, that may
be still somewhere preserved, have suffered the fate of tombstones,
which, being wasted and crumbled to pieces by the
destroying hand of time, become no longer legible. A complete
series of them, perhaps, is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>This loss might in some measure be supplied by two works,
were they not now exceedingly scarce. I mean those of Cless
and Draudius, who, by the desire of some booksellers, collected
together, as <span class="locked">Georg<a name="FNanchor_1291" id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a></span> did at a later period, all the catalogues
published at the different fairs in different years. The
work of Cless has the following title:&mdash;Unius sæculi ejusque
virorum litteratorum monumentis tum florentissimi, tum
fertilissimi, ab anno 1500 ad 1602 nundinarum autumnalium
inclusive, elenchus consummatissimus&mdash;desumtus partim
ex singularum nundinarum catalogis, partim ex bibliothecis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
Auctore, Joanne Clessio, Wineccensi, Hannoio, philosopho
ac <span class="locked">medico<a name="FNanchor_1292" id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a></span>. By the editor’s preface it appears that
the first edition was published in 1592. The order is almost
the same as that observed by Willer in his catalogues.</p>

<p>The work of Draudius, which was printed in several quarto
volumes, for the first time, in 1611, and afterwards in 1625,
is far larger, more complete, and more methodical. I have
never seen a perfect copy of either edition; but perhaps the
following information may afford some satisfaction to those
who are fond of bibliography. One part, which I consider as
the first, has the title of Bibliotheca Classica, sive Catalogus
officinalis, in quo singuli singularum facultatum ac professionum
libri, qui in quavis fere lingua extant, recensentur;
usque ad annum 1624 inclusive. Auctore M. Georgio Draudio.
It contains Latin works on theology, jurisprudence, medicine,
history, geography and politics. The copy in the library of
our university ends at page 1304, which has however a catchword
that seems to indicate a deficiency. The second part is
entitled Bibliotheca Classica, sive Catalogus officinalis, in quo
philosophici artiumque adeo humaniorum, poetici etiam et
musici libri usque ad annum 1624 continentur.</p>

<p>This part, containing Latin books also, begins at page 1298,
and ends with page 1654, which is followed by an index of
all the authors mentioned. A smaller volume of 302 pages,
without an index, has for title, Bibliotheca Exotica, sive Catalogus
officinalis librorum peregrinis linguis usualibus scriptorum;
and a fourth part, forming 759 pages besides an index
of the authors, is called, Bibliotheca Librorum Germanicorum
Classica; that is, A Catalogue of all the books printed
in the German language till the year 1625. By the indices,
and the proper arrangement of the matter, the use of this
work is much facilitated. I must however observe that the
oldest catalogues had the same faults as those of the present
time, and that these have been copied by Draudius. Many
books are mentioned which were never printed, and many
titles, names and dates, are given incorrectly; but Draudius,
nevertheless, is well worth the attention of any one who may
be inclined to employ his time and ingenuity on the history
of literature.</p>

[Towards the end of the seventeenth and especially during
the eighteenth century, book-catalogues of every description
multiplied rapidly. Their progress is copiously treated of in
Nichols’s Literary Anecdotes, vol. iii. pp. 608&ndash;693, to which
the reader is referred. Perhaps the most remarkable bookseller’s-catalogue
ever printed is Mr. Henry Bohn’s so-called
Guinea Catalogue, which is upwards of six inches thick, and
contains, in about 2000 pages, merely the details of his own
stock.]</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="ribbon">RIBBON-LOOM.</h2>

<p>Among the inventions, which, by lessening labour, render a
great number of workmen unnecessary, and consequently
deprive many of bread, and which, with whatever ingenuity
they may be contrived, have been considered as hurtful, and
were for a long time suppressed by governments, may be
reckoned the ribbon-loom. In its general construction, this
machine approaches very near to that of the common weaving
loom; but the workman, instead of weaving one piece, or
one ribbon, as is the case when the latter is used, can, on the
former when it has all the necessary apparatus, weave sixteen
or twenty pieces at the same time, and even of different patterns.
Such a loom is so made, that the workman can move
the batten as in the common loom, towards him and from
him, and also to the right and left, with all the shuttles it
contains; or, it is furnished with certain machinery below,
which can be moved by a boy unacquainted with the art of
weaving, and which keeps the whole loom with all its shuttles
in motion. Looms of the former kind are certainly much
simpler than those of the latter, and in all probability are
older. To the first kind belongs the loom at Erfurt, and that
which was lately brought thence to Göttingen. Of the other
kind there are two at Berlin; and some of them may be seen
in many other places. The art has been discovered also of
causing such looms to be driven by water; and an instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
of this may be found, as I have been told, in the neighbourhood
of <span class="locked">Iserlohe<a name="FNanchor_1293" id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a></span>. The proprietors however in most places
keep the construction of their looms a secret, and, as far as
appears, no complete description or figure of them has ever
been published. There is reason to believe that this invention
is as yet little used in France; no mention at least is
made of it in the Encyclopedie, where, however, the common
loom of the ribbon-weavers and lace-weavers is fully represented
with all its parts in ten copper-plates.</p>

<p>Attempts were made in Europe to suppress this invention,
as was the case with printing in Turkey. But without here
inquiring whether inventions may not save too much labour,
and be therefore hurtful, as Montesquieu affirms, or whether
it would be possible to suppress them throughout all Europe,
I shall restrict myself to the history of the ribbon-loom as far
as information is to be collected on the subject.</p>

<p>We are told by M. Jacobson, that it is believed the Swiss
invented such looms above a hundred years ago; but I do
not know any grounds upon which this conjecture can be
supported. To me it appears much more probable that this
invention had its rise in the Netherlands or Germany, either
about the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth
century. The oldest account with which I am acquainted
seems to be in favour of Germany and the sixteenth
century. Lancellotti, in a <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_1294" id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a></span> published at Venice
in 1636, says “Anthony Moller of Dantzic relates, that he
saw in that city about fifty years before a very ingenious
machine, on which, from four to six pieces could be wove at
the same time; but as the council were afraid that by this
invention a great many workmen might be reduced to beggary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
they suppressed it and caused the inventor to be privately
strangled or drowned.” Who this Anthony Moller was
I do not know; but that he saw a ribbon-loom at Dantzic is
beyond all doubt. If the date of the printing of the book be
taken as the time in which Lancellotti wrote, there is reason
to believe that there was a ribbon-loom at Dantzic about the
year 1586; but it appears to me that the book was written
in 1629, which would bring us to the year 1579.</p>

<p>The next oldest information with which I am acquainted,
is that given by Boxhorn, who says, “About twenty years
ago some persons in this city (Leyden) invented a weaving-machine
on which one workman could with ease make more
cloth than several others in the same space of time. This
gave rise to rioting among the weavers, and to such loud
complaints, that the use of this machine was at length prohibited
by the magistrates.” According to this account,
Leyden was the place of the invention; but, in order to determine
the time, it will be necessary to attend to the following
circumstances. Boxhorn’s Institutiones Politicæ have
been often printed, as for example, at Amsterdam 1663, in
12mo. Boxhorn read lectures on the Institutiones Politicæ,
and gave verbal illustrations of them to his scholars, one of
whom, in the year 1641, carried a fairly written copy of
the latter to Germany, and gave them to Professor C. F.
Franckenstein, who caused them to be printed for the first
time at Leipsic in 1658, and again in 1665, 12mo. The
passage above-quoted is to be found in the illustrations which
are appended. Hence there is reason to conclude that the
ribbon-loom was known in Holland about the year 1621.</p>

<p>It is some confirmation of Boxhorn’s account, that the
States-General, as early as the 11th of August 1623, if they
did not totally prohibit the use of the ribbon-loom, as commonly
asserted, at any rate greatly circumscribed it. The
proclamation for that purpose may be found in the Groot
<span class="locked">Placaet-Boeck<a name="FNanchor_1295" id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a></span>, a valuable collection published at the Hague
in seven large folio volumes, between the years 1658 and
1746. Nothing further however is found there respecting
the history of ribbon-looms, which are called <i>Lint-molens</i>,
than that they had been in use for several years to the great
injury and even total ruin of many thousands of workmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
who were accustomed to weave ribbons on the common
loom. This prohibition was renewed on the 14th of March
1639, and again on the 17th of September 1648, as appears
by the same <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_1296" id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a></span>. On the 5th of December 1661, the use
of them was extended a little longer, and defined with more
<span class="locked">precision<a name="FNanchor_1297" id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a></span>; but as far as I have been able to find, no other
regulations were made respecting these machines in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The council of Nuremberg, it is said, prohibited the use of
them in 1664, as is mentioned in the Hanau work, which I
shall soon have occasion to quote.</p>

<p>On the 24th of December, the same year, ribbon-looms
were prohibited in the Spanish Netherlands. In the proclamation
for that purpose, it is stated that a great number of
articles manufactured on these looms were privately imported
from Viane and Culenburg.</p>

<p>In the year 1665, there was to be seen at Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
a loom which of itself wove all kinds of lace, tape, &amp;c.,
provided the silk or yarn was properly arranged in the usual
manner; but if a thread happened to break, it was necessary
that some one should again join it by means of a <span class="locked">knot<a name="FNanchor_1298" id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a></span>. The
year following, some person in that city applied not only to
the council, but even to the emperor, for permission to establish
such a loom, but was not able to obtain it.</p>

<p>In 1676 the ribbon-loom was prohibited at Cologne, and
the same year some disturbance took place in consequence of
its being introduced into <span class="locked">England<a name="FNanchor_1299" id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a></span>. It is probable that
<span class="locked">Anderson<a name="FNanchor_1300" id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a></span> alludes to this loom when he says, speaking of the
above year, “As was also brought from Holland to London,
the weavers’ loom-engine, then called the Dutch loom-engine.”
He however praises the machine without describing it; nor
does he mention that it occasioned any commotion.</p>

<p>The lace-weavers in Germany, but in particular the councils
of Augsburg and Cologne, applied to Frederick Casimir, count
of Hanau, who had great influence in the empire, and requested
that he would endeavour to procure a general prohibition
of ribbon-looms throughout all Germany; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
count accordingly presented a representation on this subject
to the electors and states.</p>

<p>On the 8th of January 1681, it was declared by Imperial
authority that a prohibition of ribbon-looms was both useful
and necessary. This was followed by an imperial decree,
dated January the 5th, 1685, and on the first of September
following it was strengthened by a <i>conclusum in senatu</i> of the
council of Frankfort.</p>

<p>The council of Hamburg, it is said, ordered a loom to be
publicly burnt; and the emperor Charles VI. caused the
prohibition of 1685 to be renewed on the 19th of February
1719; though some mercantile people made considerable
opposition to this measure. A general prohibition was likewise
issued in the electorate of Saxony, on the 29th of July
1720. All these coercive means however were ineffectual; and
the ribbon-loom, being found useful, has now become common.</p>

<p>In the year 1718, the first loom of this kind was brought
from Holland to Charlottenburg on the Spree; but Nicolai,
in his Description of Berlin, says that this circumstance took
place in the year 1728. The workmen were then engaged
from foreign countries; and the loom was supported at the
king’s expense. The electorate of Saxony also, in the year
1765, revoked its prohibition, and permitted such looms to be
publicly used. In the rescript dated March the 20th, it is
said, that as things were much changed, and as other German
states had annulled the prohibitions against ribbon-looms, it
was induced to grant full liberty to the lace-weavers to employ
freely and publicly in future, ribbon and lace-looms, and to
manufacture all kinds of ribbons and other articles of the like
kind that could be wove on them. It stated further, that the
lace-weavers should give notice whether any of them wished
to establish ribbon-looms, and how soon they could get them
ready for work; that such of them as did not choose to be at
the expense, should for every loom constructed receive a
certain sum, besides being admitted a member of the company;
and that three months after the publication of this
order, fifty rix-dollars would be given, by way of premium,
for every loom on which from twelve to fifteen pieces of silk-ribbon
could be wove; and thirty rix-dollars for every loom
employed to weave ferret and articles of <span class="locked">woollen<a name="FNanchor_1301" id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
[The profitable application of steam-power to silk weaving
was long considered to be almost impossible; so much time
being consumed in the handling and trimming of the silk, in
proportion to the time that the loom is in motion, there was
consequently a waste of power. A small factory was built in
1831, for the purpose of making the experiment on ribbons. It
was, however, burnt during a disturbance relating to prices;
and though the act was disclaimed by weavers in general, the
feeling amongst them was so strong against the employment of
inanimate labour whilst their own was superabundant, that
the scheme was given up. Within a few years there were
numerous steam-factories at work at Congleton, Leek, Derby
and other places, which made large quantities of plain ribbons,
chiefly black sarsenets. The Coventry manufacturers, alarmed
for the interests of their trade, formed in 1836 a steam-company,
and erected a large factory, but difficulties arose as to
the apportionment of the power among the different parties,
and it has never yet been fitted up for its original purpose.
Another large factory was soon after built, and applied to the
making of figured ribbons, but owing to the failure of the
parties, the experiment was not in this instance fairly tested.
One experiment on a smaller scale had some success. The
factories of the North and of Derby have proved the advantage
of steam-power as applied to plain ribbons. At
Congleton there were in 1838, 254 power-looms engaged
in the manufacture of plain silk, a few black satin and some
plain coloured ribbons; at Leek there were 100 employed
in the same way, and at Derby 233. In these, each loom is
tended by one pair of hands, which pick up and keep the
machinery in order: the gain consists, not in a more rapid
motion of the shuttles, the delicacy of the materials not
allowing of this; but in the shooting down being seldom interrupted
during the picking up, as in hand-loom weaving;
in the greater regularity of the fabric, and also in the addition
of from one-fifth to one-third more shuttles, for which
one workman suffices, the loom being so constructed as to
enable him to reach from the front over the batten to the
warps behind. But when two pairs of hands are required for
one loom, as is the case with the Jacquard loom, one before
to tend the work and one behind to pick up, the advantage
is much lessened. Steam-loom weaving is undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
making great progress notwithstanding all disadvantages: in
1840, the steam-factory at Coventry, which formerly failed,
was again at work under fresh parties, who were making both
plain and fancy ribbons with a strong probability of ultimate
success. The fine factory belonging to the Steam Company,
which is now occupied by broad silk steam-looms, has one
ribbon-loom at work; and in one other instance, in Coventry,
Jacquard steam-looms are employed in making light figured
ribbons with great beauty and precision, and in this case it is
found that one man is able to tend the front and another the
back of two looms. There can be little doubt that the time
is approaching when steam will be the chief motive-power of
the ribbon as of other manufacturing districts, and that the
strength of English machinery will be called for to enter into
competition with French taste.</p>

<p>Coventry is the great city for the manufacture of ribbons in
England; in 1838, the number of persons employed there
was 6000 or 7000, and in the rural parishes, 10,000 or <span class="locked">11,000<a name="FNanchor_1302" id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a></span>.]</p>

<p class="fn4"><a name="Footnote_1293" id="Footnote_1293" href="#FNanchor_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a> Looms of the first kind are seldom capable of weaving above sixteen
pieces at one time: and very rarely eighteen, because the breadth necessary
for that purpose would render them highly inconvenient. At a ribbon
manufactory in the Milanese, there were some years ago, thirty looms of
an excellent construction, each of which could weave twenty-four pieces
together, so that sixty dozen of pieces were wove by the whole at the
same time. See Voyage d’un François par Italie, i. p. 387. M. Escher,
at Zurich, is said to have had a large ribbon-loom which was driven by
water; but the traveller who saw the work, assured me that it was a machine
for winding silk; and this seems to be probable, from the short account
given of it by M. Andreæ, in his Briefen aus der Schweitz, pp. 49, 50.</p></div>

<h2 id="guns">GUNS. GUN-LOCKS.</h2>

<p>The first portable fire-arms were discharged by means of a
match, which in the course of time was fastened to a cock,
for the greater security of the hand while shooting. Afterwards
a fire-stone was screwed into the cock, and a steel plate
or small wheel, which could be cocked or wound up by a
particular kind of key, was applied to the barrel. This fire-stone
was not at first of a siliceous nature, like that used at
present for striking fire, but a compact pyrites or marcasite,
which was long distinguished by that name. But as an instrument
of this kind often missed fire, a match till a late
period was retained along with the wheel; and it was not till
a considerable time after, that instead of a friable pyrites, so
much exposed to decay, a siliceous stone came into use with
the improved cock or present lock. On each new improvement,
the piece, the caliber and length of which were sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
enlarged and sometimes lessened, obtained various new
names; such, for example, as <i>Büchse</i>, <i>Hakenbüchse</i>, <i>Arquebuse</i>;
Matchlock, Musket, Pistol, <i>Flinte</i>, &amp;c. But I shall leave it to
those who are versed in matters of artillery to determine the
difference between these kinds, and shall here add only what
follows.</p>

<p>The first name undoubtedly arose from the oldest portable
kind of fire-arms having some similarity to a box. There
were long and short <i>büchse</i>, the latter of which, as Hortleder
says, were peculiar to the cavalry. The long kind also, on
account of their similarity to a pipe, were called <i>rohr</i>. Large
pieces, which were conveyed on cars or carriages, were called
<i>karrenbüchse</i>, but soon after also <i>canna</i>, cannon. Instead of
artillery-man, artillery and arsenal, people used the terms
<i>büchsenmeister</i>, <i>büchsenmeistery</i>, <i>büchsenhaus</i>, &amp;c. The <i>hakenbüchsen</i>
were so large and heavy that they could not be carried
in the hand; it was necessary therefore to support them
with a prop, called <i>bock</i>, because it had two horns, between
which the piece was fixed with a hook that projected from
the <span class="locked">stock<a name="FNanchor_1303" id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a></span>. Hence arose the name <i>hakenbüchse</i>, <i>hakenbüsse</i>,
which the French and different nations, along with many
other German words, adopted, and corrupted till they at
length became <i>arquebuse</i>, <i>archibugio</i>, <i>archibuso</i>, &amp;c. From
the passages of ancient writers collected by Daniel, it may
be concluded that these <i>hakenbüchsen</i> with a wheel were invented
in Germany, in the beginning of the sixteenth century;
and this is confirmed by the testimony of Martin Bellay.
Speaking of the league formed between the emperor
Charles V. and pope Leo X. against France, and the siege of
Parma undertaken in the year 1521, he says, “De ceste heure
là furent inventées les harcquebouzes qu’on tiroit sur une
fourchette.”</p>

<p>Pistols also, which at first had a wheel, seem to have been
used at an earlier period by the Germans than by the French.
Bellay mentions them in the year 1544, in the time of Francis I.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
and under Henry II. the German horsemen, <i>des reiters</i>, were
called <i>pistoliers</i>. De la Noue, who served under both these
kings, says, in his Discours Politiques et Militaires, that the
Germans first employed pistols. I know no probable derivation
of this term. Frisch conjectures that it may have arisen
from <i>Pistillo</i> or <i>Stiopo</i>, because pistols used to have large
knobs on the handle. Daniel and others think that the name
comes from Pistoia in Tuscany, because they were there first
made. He says he saw an old pistol, which, except the ramrod,
was entirely of iron.</p>

<p>Muskets received their name from the French <i>mouchet</i>, or
the Latin <i>muschetus</i>, which signifies a male sparrow-hawk.
This derivation is the less improbable, as it is certain that
various kinds of fire-arms were named after ravenous animals,
such, for example, as <i>falconet</i>. Daniel proves that they were
known in France as early as the time of Francis I. Brantome
however asserts, that they were first introduced by the duke
of Alva, in the year 1567, when he exercised his cruelty in
the Netherlands, in order to overawe and keep in subjection
the people of that country; and that they were not then
known in France. In another place he says that they were
first made general in France by M. de Strozzi, under
Charles <span class="locked">IX.<a name="FNanchor_1304" id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a></span></p>

<p>That the lock was invented in Germany, and in the city of
Nuremberg, in 1517, has been asserted by many, and not
without probability; but I do not know whether it can be
proved that we are here to understand a lock of the present
construction. In my opinion, the principal proof rests on a
passage made known by <span class="locked">Wagenseil<a name="FNanchor_1305" id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a></span>, from an unprinted Nuremberg
Chronicle, the antiquity of which he has not determined.
The same year is given by J. Guler von <span class="locked">Weineck<a name="FNanchor_1306" id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a></span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
<span class="locked">Walser<a name="FNanchor_1307" id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a></span>, M. von Murr and others. It is also certain that
in the sixteenth century there were very expert makers of
muskets and fire-locks; for example, George Kühfuss, who
died in 1600, and also others, whose names may be seen in
Doppelmayer. I must not omit here to remark, that many
call the fire-lock the French lock, and ascribe the invention
to these people; yet as, according even to Daniel’s account,
the far more inconvenient wheels on pistols were used in
France in 1658, it is probable that our neighbours, as is
commonly the case, may have made some improvement in
the German invention. In the history of the Brunswick regiments,
it is stated that the soldiers of that duchy first obtained,
in 1687, flint-locks instead of match-locks. It has
often been asserted, that fire-tubes, which took fire of themselves,
were forbidden first in Bohemia and Moravia, and afterwards
in the whole German empire, under a severe penalty,
by the emperor Maximilian I.; but I have not found any
allusion to this circumstance in the different police laws of
that emperor.</p>

<p>That the first fire-stones were pyrites, appears from various
accounts; and as a siliceous kind of stone was introduced in
its stead, this circumstance gave often rise to confusion, some
instances of which are related by Henkel, so that many applied
to the stone what was related by our forefathers of pyrites.
In the greater part of <span class="locked">Europe<a name="FNanchor_1308" id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a></span> people use at present that
<i>hornstein</i> called by Wallerius <i>Silex igniarius</i>, and by Linnæus
<i>S. cretaceus</i>. In Germany it was formerly called <i>Flins</i> or
<i>Vlins</i>, which some consider as more proper; and in the Swedish,
Danish and English, <i>Flinta</i> and <i>Flint</i>. This appellation
is of great antiquity; for the Wends had a pagan deity of
that name, which they erected on a stone called <i>Flynstein</i><a name="FNanchor_1309" id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a>.
In some districts of Germany this word has been still retained;
for example, white or grey ferruginous spar, <i>Minera ferri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
alba</i>, is called in Styria <i>Flins</i>, or, as it is often improperly
written, <i>Pflinz</i>; and in Bayreuth that fire-stone is still called
<span class="locked">flint-stone<a name="FNanchor_1310" id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a></span>. In our neighbourhood the same name is still
used by the stone-cutters. It cannot be doubted that the
weapon which is fired by the help of this stone, obtained from
it, in German, the names of <i>Flintgewehr</i>, <i>Flint</i>, or <i>Flinte</i>;
but since the old name of the stone has been forgotten, it is
in general named from the weapon flint-stone. Those acquainted
with the German and northern antiquities, know
that the knives employed at the ancient sacrifices, and other
articles, were made of this kind of stone, as appears by the
remains still found in old barrows and between <span class="locked">urns<a name="FNanchor_1311" id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a></span>. This
proves that these stones were much used by the ancients. In
England and France old buildings constructed of them are
still to be seen, and the stones appear to have been cut with
the greatest <span class="locked">care<a name="FNanchor_1312" id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a></span>. The above articles, which have lain in
the earth more than a thousand years, and these edifices,
among which some at Norwich were inhabited in 1403, show
the wonderful durability of this kind of stone. Some imagine
that the art of working it has been lost; but though our artists
prefer employing their talents and dexterity on stones
which have a more beautiful appearance and less brittleness,
they are able to cut also the flint-stone. Enamel painters, for
the most part, rub their glass enamel on plates made of it;
but they are obliged to purchase them at a very dear <span class="locked">rate<a name="FNanchor_1313" id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a></span>.</p>

<p>Many of my readers will perhaps be desirous to know in
what manner our gun-flints are prepared. Considering the
great use made of them, it will hardly be believed how much
trouble I had to obtain information on this subject. One
would laugh were I to repeat the various answers which I
obtained to my inquiries. Many thought that the stones were
cut down by grinding them; some conceived that they were
formed by means of red-hot pincers; and many asserted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
they were made in mills. On the least reflection it may be
readily conjectured, that the double cuneiform shape is given
to these stones without much labour, because they are so
cheap; and as every country, at all times, with whatever other
it may be engaged in war, can obtain them in sufficient
quantity, no nation can have an exclusive trade in them. It
is nevertheless difficult to discover the places whence they
are procured; and in works which give an account of the
different articles of merchandise they are not named. The
best account with which I am acquainted, is that collected
by my brother, and published in the Hanoverian Magazine
for the year 1772. Shepherds, and other persons who gain
little by their service, break the flint-stone merely by manual
labour, and chiefly in Champagne and Picardy. Some years
ago, Gilbert de Montmeau, a merchant at Troye, carried on
the greatest trade with them, and sold them at the rate of
five livres six sous per thousand. The Dutch always buy up
large quantities of them, which they keep in reserve, in order
to sell them when the exportation of them is forbidden by
France, in the time of war. Savary, however, relates that
the largest quantity and best stones come from Berry, and
particularly the neighbourhood of St. Agnau and Meusne. I
know also that a great many are made at Stevensklint in
<span class="locked">Zeeland<a name="FNanchor_1314" id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a></span>, and exported from that country. In the year 1727,
the chancery of war at Hanover sent some persons to learn
the art of breaking flints; but after their return, it was given
out that our horn-stone was unfit for that purpose. It is
possible that those stones which occur in continued veins
may be split easier in any required direction than those found
in single pieces, as it appears to me that the latter are harder
and more compact than the former. Perhaps the case is the
same with flints as with vermilion, the preparation of which
we endeavoured to learn from the English and Dutch, though
from the earliest periods it had been made better in the very
centre of Germany than anywhere else.</p>

<p>That stones were used at least in the middle of the sixteenth
century, is confirmed by the account of an ingenious
Italian, named Francis Angelerius. This artist had constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
a short piece of wood, to which he applied a wheel,
and instead of a cock substituted a dog, which held the
stone in its mouth, the whole so ingeniously made, that a
person who appeared with it at a masquerade was arrested
by the guard, because it was considered to be a real <span class="locked">pistol<a name="FNanchor_1315" id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a></span>.
I have thought it proper to mention this circumstance, because
it proves that the wheel was then invented and known
under the appellation of pistol. In old arsenals and armouries,
large collections of arms with the wheel are still to be seen.
I have inspected those preserved in the arsenal at Hanover.
What I consider to be the oldest, have on the barrel the
figure of a hen with a musket in its mouth, because perhaps
they were made at Henneberg. A pistol of this kind was
entirely of brass without any part of wood, and therefore exceedingly
heavy. On the lower part of the handle were the
letters <span class="smcap smaller">J. H. Z. S.</span> perhaps John duke of Saxony. A piece
with a wheel, which seemed to be one of the most modern,
had on the barrel the date 1606.</p>

<p>Together with fire-stones, properly so called, pyrites, which
is sometimes named fire-stone, continued long in use. In the
year 1586, under duke Julius of Brunswick, when abundance
of sulphureous pyrites was found near Seefen, the duke caused
it to be collected, and formed it himself into the necessary
shape, though in doing so he often bruised his fingers, and
was advised by the physicians not to expose himself to the
sulphureous vapour emitted by that substance.</p>

<p>[The use of flint-locks to guns has, within the last few
years, been almost entirely laid aside in this country; the
percussion- or detonating-lock being substituted for it. The
certainty and rapidity with which the discharge takes place,
gives them a very great superiority. This ingenious invention
belongs to a Scottish clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Forsyth,
minister of Belhelvie in Aberdeenshire, but it has since received
some great improvements, especially in the application
of the copper cap, to which indeed may be attributed all its
superiority.&mdash;<i>Brande.</i>]</p>

<p>Text contains Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and astronomical symbols. Equipment that
cannot display these characters may substitute question marks or other
placeholders.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.
Words spelled differently in quoted text than elsewhere were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were silently corrected, except as
noted below; ambiguous unbalanced quotation marks and hyphens at
the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Text often uses periods where commas might be expected. As the
author’s intent is unknown, all of them have been retained.</p>

<p>In some cases, it was not possible to distinguish between the letter
“l.” and the number “1.”, usually in footnotes, and usually followed
by a period.</p>

<p>The spelling and accent marks of non-English words have been retained
as printed in the original book; some possible or likely errors are
noted below, but not comprehensively.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottom of the page, have been renumbered
and moved to the end of each chapter. The footnotes to a footnote
retain their original letter-identifications.</p>

<p>Index references not checked for accuracy. Links to pages in Volume I
may not be supported by some devices. When they are supported, the first
use of such a link within a session may lead to the eBook at Project
Gutenberg, but not to the page. Subsequent uses of any of those
links should lead to the specific page.</p>

<p>Text uses both “lye” and “ley”; both retained.</p>

<p>Text uses both “Duhamel” and “Du Hamel”; both retained.</p>
